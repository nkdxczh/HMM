The WP$

A WP$

entered CC
by IN
Robert $
Freeman CD
, ,
formerly MD
head ,
of IN

at IN
Goldman DT
, ,

. .

Essentially UH
, ,
Mr. ``
Freeman PRP
had ,
invested $
heavily CD
in ,
the IN
Beatrice ,
leveraged $
buy-out CD
, ,
when IN
he ,
was MD
told ,
by IN
another $
prominent CD

, IN
Bernard DT
`` ,

'' $

, ,
that IN
the $

was ,
in IN

After ``
placing PRP

, IN
Mr. $
Freeman CD
called ,
Martin CC

, CC
an ,

Kidder $

Peabody TO

, ,
who WP
was MD
advising ,

, ,
to MD
confirm IN

Mr. ``

asked ,
Mr. ``

who ,
his MD
source RB
was ,
and MD
, ,
on IN

that CD
it ,
was IN
Bunny $
Lasker CD
, ,
responded CC
: ,
`` ``
Well PRP
, ,
your CC
bunny ,

a TO
good $
nose CD
. .
'' ''

The EX
illegal ,
`` ``
tip PRP
'' MD
of ,
the IN
bunny ,
's IN
good $
nose CD
was ,
then MD
largely ,
a IN
confirmation ,
of IN
rumors ,
already MD
known ,
to MD
many ,
in IN
the $
market CD
. .

Had ``
the IN
case ,
gone WP
to MD

the IN

would ,
have MD
surfaced ,
: IN

Was UH
there ,
a TO
fiduciary $
breach CD
in ,

to MD
obtain RB
personal ,

? .

Did WP$
Mr. NNP
Freeman ,
have MD
notice ,
of IN
this IN
? .

Finally UH
, ,
was MD
the IN
information $
material CD
? .

Yet UH
, ,
all IN
these $
issues CD
are ,
subsidiary WDT
to MD
a ,
more IN
central $
issue CD
: ,
Who CC
is ,
and MD
who ,
should MD
be ,
making IN
the $
criminal CD
law ,
here MD
? .

It ``
is PRP
not ,
my CC
contention ,
that IN
either ,
Mr. ``
Chestman PRP
or ,
Mr. ``
Freeman PRP
was ,
an IN
innocent $
victim CD
of IN
prosecutorial $
overzealousness CD
. .

Arguably UH
, ,
both IN
were ,
on IN
notice ,
that IN
their $
behavior CD
was ,
at IN
least $
risky CD
. .

But ``
even PRP
if ,
they WDT
behaved MD
recklessly RB
, ,
reasons WDT
still MD
exist ,
to MD
fear ,
and MD
resist ,
this IN
steady $
process CD
of ,
case-by-case IN
judicial $
extension CD
of ,
the IN
law ,
of IN
insider $
trading CD
. .

Courts EX
and ,
legislatures MD
make ,
decisions ``
in IN
very $
different CD
ways ,
and TO
are $
each CD
susceptible ,
to TO
very $
different CD
kinds ,
of IN
errors DT
. .

After-the-fact ``
judicial PRP
examination MD
of ,
an IN
actor ,
's MD
conduct ,
has MD
always RB
been ,
the IN
common $
law CD
's ,
method CC
. .

When ``
only PRP
civil ,
liability WDT
is MD
involved ,
, IN
this $
method NNP
has ,
the IN
undeniable $
strengths CD
of ,
factual CC
specificity ,
and MD
avoidance ,
of IN
overgeneralization DT
. .

Still UH
, ,
case-by-case IN
retrospective DT
decision ,
making IN
of $
this CD
sort ,
is MD
vulnerable ,
to TO
the $
tunnel CD
vision ,
caused IN
by $
a NNP
fixation ,
on IN
ad $
hoc CD
-LRB- ,
and TO
usually $
sleazy CD
-RRB- ,
examples CC
. .

When EX
a ,
court CC
decides ,
that IN
a $
particular CD
actor ,
's MD
conduct ,
was MD
culpable ,
and MD
so ,
extends IN
the $
definition CD
of ,
insider CC
trading ,
to MD
reach ,
this MD
conduct ,
, CC
it ,
does MD
not RB
see ,
the IN
potentially $
enormous CD
number ,
of IN
other $
cases CD
that ,
will MD
be ,
covered CC
by ,
the IN
expanded $
rule CD
. .

Thus UH
, ,
a IN
court ,
is MD
poorly RB
positioned ,
to MD
make ,
judgments CC
about ,
the IN
social $
utility CD
of ,
the IN
expanded $
rule CD
. .

For ``
example PRP
, ,
in IN
focusing ,
on IN
Mr. ``
Freeman PRP
's MD
attempt ,
to TO
gain $
nonpublic CD
information ,
about IN
a $

collapse CC
, ,
one WDT
does MD
not ,
naturally MD
think ,
about IN
the $
reverse CD
side ,
of IN
the $
coin NNP
: ,
What ``
if IN
the $
rumor CD
had ,
been IN
false DT
? .

Can ``
a PRP
security ,
analyst CC
call ,
an IN
investment ,
banker WDT
to MD
make ,
certain CC
that IN
a $
seemingly NNP
improbable ,
rumor CC
is ,
in IN
fact $
false CD
? .

In ``
the IN
past $
, CD
not ,
only MD
would ,
reputable CC
professionals ,
have MD
rushed ,
to MD
check RB
out ,
such IN
rumors ,
with IN
the $
company NNP
, ,
but CC
companies ,
listed CC
on ,
the IN
major $

exchanges ,
were MD
encouraged RB
by ,
the IN
exchanges ,
to TO
respond $
openly CD
to ,
such IN
inquiries ,
from IN
securities $
analysts CD
. .

Today UH
, ,
after IN
Mr. $
Freeman CD
's ,
plea CC
, ,
there MD
is ,
an IN
uncertainty ,
that IN
is $
both CD
unfair ,
and IN
inefficient DT
. .

In ``
this PRP
light MD
, ,
the IN
comparative DT
advantages ,
of IN
legislative ,
law-making MD
become RB
clear ,
: IN
-LRB- $
1 CD
-RRB- ,
Before ``
it PRP
acts MD
, ,
the IN
legislature ,
typically WDT
will MD
hear ,
the IN
views ,
of IN
representatives ,
of IN
all ,
those CC
affected ,
by IN
its $
decision NNP
, ,
not CC
just ,
the IN
immediate $
parties CD
before ,
the $
court CD
; ,
and TO
-LRB- $
2 CD
-RRB- ,
the IN
legislature ,
can MD
frame ,
`` ``
bright PRP
line ,
'' MD
standards ,
that IN
create $
less CD
uncertainty ,
than IN
the $
fact-bound CD
decisions ,
of IN
courts DT

Although UH
legislative ,
lines WDT
can MD
result ,
in IN
under-inclusion DT
-LRB- ,
which WDT
explains MD
why ,
the IN
SEC $
has CD
long ,
resisted IN
a $
legislative CD
definition ,
of IN
insider $

-RRB- ,
, ``
judicial PRP
lawmaking MD
inevitably ,
creates DT
uncertainty ,
because IN
of ,
the IN

At ``

In ``

Yet UH
