In WP$

`` ``
Well UH

your RP

The PRP$
illegal RBS
`` ``

of RP
the DT
bunny UH

good JJS

was VBD
then RP
largely VBN
a RP
confirmation VBN
of RP
rumors VBN
already RP
known VBN
to RP
many PRP$
in VBD
the RP
market VBN

Had VBD
the RP
case VBN
gone RP
to TO
trial VB
the RP
same VBN
issues PRP
would MD
have VB
surfaced RBS
: .

Was ``
there VBD
a RP

order VBG
to PRP$
obtain VB
personal PRP$

? .

Did ``
Mr. WRB
Freeman MD
have VB
notice RP
of IN
this RBS
? .

Finally UH
, ,
was VBD
the RP
information PRP$
material RBS
? .

Yet UH
, ,
all RP
these PRP$
issues PRP
are VBP
subsidiary VBD
to RP
a PRP$
more VBD
central RP
issue VBN
: :
Who PRP
is VBD
and RP
who VBN
should MD
be VB
making VBG
the RP
criminal VBN
law PRP$
here RBS
? .

It ``
is UH
not PRP
my VBD
contention RP
that VBN
either WRB
Mr. PRP
Chestman VBD
or RP
Mr. PRP$
Freeman CC
was VBD
an RP
innocent PRP$
victim VBD
of RP
prosecutorial PRP$
overzealousness RBS
. .

Arguably VBG
, RP
both PRP$
were VBD
on RP
notice VBN
that WRB
their PRP$
behavior PRP
was VBD
at RP
least PRP$
risky RBS
. .

But CC
even VB
if WRB
they PRP
behaved MD
recklessly VB
, RP
reasons VBN
still RP
exist VBG
to RP
fear VBN
and CC
resist RP
this VBG
steady RP
process VBG
of RP
case-by-case PRP$
judicial VBG
extension RP
of VBG
the RP
law VBN
of RP
insider PRP$
trading RBS

Courts ``

make VB
decisions RP
in VBG
very RP
different PRP$
ways VBN
and CC
are VBP
each RP
susceptible VBN
to RP
very PRP$
different VBG
kinds RP
of IN
errors RBS
. .

After-the-fact ``
judicial PRP$
examination VBD
of RP
an DT
actor UH
's POS
conduct JJS
has VBD
always RP
been VBN
the RP
common PRP$
law VBD
's RP
method VBN
. .

When WRB
only PRP
civil MD
liability VB
is RP
involved VBN
, RP
this PRP$
method JJS
has VBD
the RP
undeniable PRP$
strengths VBD
of RP
factual PRP$
specificity VBN
and CC
avoidance VBD
of RP
overgeneralization VBN
. .

Still VBG
, RP
case-by-case PRP$
retrospective VBD
decision RP
making VBG
of RP
this PRP$
sort VBD
is RP
vulnerable VBN
to RP
the PRP$
tunnel VBD
vision RP
caused VBN
by RP
a PRP$
fixation VBD
on RP
ad VBG

-LRB- PRP$
and CC
usually VBD
sleazy RP
-RRB- DT
examples FW

When WRB
a PRP$
court VBD
decides RP
that VBN
a PRP$
particular CC
actor UH

conduct JJS
was VBD
culpable RP
and VBN
so RP
extends VBN
the RP
definition VBN
of RP
insider PRP$
trading VBG
to PRP$
reach VB
this PRP$
conduct JJS
, WRB
it PRP
does MD
not RB
see VB
the RP
potentially VBN
enormous RP
number VBN
of RP
other PRP$
cases VBD
that PRP
will MD
be VB
covered RP
by VBN
the RP
expanded VBN

Thus UH
, ,
a RP

is RP
poorly VBN
positioned RP

judgments RP
about VBN
the RP
social VBN
utility RP

For WP

Mr. PRP$
Freeman CC

side PRP

: :
What PRP
if VBD
the RP

Can WRB

call VBG
an RP

banker RP
to TO
make VB
certain PRP$
that VBD
a RP
seemingly VBN
improbable RP

in RP
fact PRP$
false RBS

In CC
the RP
past VBN

not VBN
only PRP
would MD
reputable VB

rushed RP

check VB
out VBD
such RP

the RP

encouraged RP

Today UH

after RP
Mr. PRP$

plea VBN

there VBN
is RP
an VBN
uncertainty RP
that VBN

both PRP$

In ``
this VB
light RP

the VBD
comparative RP

clear RP

Yet UH
