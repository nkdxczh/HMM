the (

`` (
My ``

that (

`` (

Mr. (
Goldberg ``
, DT
who (
took ``
over DT
as (

the (
IRS ``
in DT

has DT
been (

what (

it (

360 (

, ``
has DT
been (
under ``
a DT
hiring (

The (

commissioner RBS
says ``
that DT
closer (
scrutiny ``

how (
the ``

uses (

will (
go ``

in (

foreign RBS
policy ``
set RBS
out ``
to DT
destroy (
Noriega ``
, DT
it (
helped ``
create DT
him (
out ``
of DT
the (
crucible ``
of DT
Panama (
's ``
long DT
history (
of ``
conspirators DT
and (
pirates ``
. DT

For (
most ``
of DT
the (
past ``
30 DT
years (
, ``
the DT
marriage (
was ``
one DT
of (
convenience ``
. DT

In (
1960 ``
, DT
for (
example ``
, DT
when (
Mr. ``
Noriega RBS
was ``
both DT
a (
cadet ``
at DT
an (
elite ``
military RBS
academy ``
in DT
Peru (
and ``
a DT
spy-in-training (
for ``
the DT
U.S. (
Defense ``
Intelligence DT
Agency (
, ``
he DT
was (
detained ``
by DT
Lima (
authorities ``
for DT
allegedly (
raping ``
and DT
savagely (
beating ``
a DT
prostitute (
, ``
according DT
to (
a ``
U.S. DT
Embassy (
cable ``
from DT
that (
period ``
. DT

The (
woman ``
had DT
nearly (
died ``
. DT

But (
U.S. ``
intelligence DT
, (
rather ``
than DT
rein (
in ``
or DT
cut (
loose ``
its DT
new (
spy ``
, DT
merely (
filed ``
the DT
report (
away ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
's DT
tips (
on ``
emerging DT
leftists (
at ``
his DT
school (
were ``
deemed DT
more (
important ``
to DT
U.S. (
interests ``
. DT

From (
that ``
point DT
on (
, ``
the DT
U.S. (
would ``
make DT
a (
practice ``
of DT
overlooking (
the ``
Panamanian DT
's (
misadventures ``
. DT

The (
U.S. ``
has RBS
befriended ``
and DT
later (
turned ``
against DT
many (
dictators ``
, DT
but (
none ``
quite DT
so (
resourceful ``
. DT

The (
55-year-old ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
is ``
n't DT
as (
smooth ``
as DT
the (
shah ``
of RBS
Iran ``
, DT
as (
well-born ``
as DT
Nicaragua (
's ``
Anastasio RBS
Somoza ``
, DT
as (
imperial ``
as DT
Ferdinand (
Marcos ``
of DT
the (
Philippines ``
or DT
as (
bloody ``
as DT
Haiti (
's ``
Baby DT
Doc (
Duvalier ``
. DT

Yet (
he ``
has RBS
proved ``
more DT
resilient (
than ``
any DT
of (
them ``
. DT

And (
out ``
of RBS
necessity ``
: DT
The (
U.S. ``
can DT
make (
mistakes ``
and DT
still (
hope ``
to DT
remove (
him ``
from DT
power (
, ``
but DT
a (
single ``
error DT
on (
his ``
part DT
could (
cost ``
him DT
his (
life ``
. DT

`` (
The ``
U.S. DT
underestimated (
Noriega ``
all DT
along (
, ``
'' DT
says (
Ambler ``
Moss RBS
, ``
a DT
former (
Ambassador ``

`` (
He ``
has RBS

with DT
America (

long DT
history (
of ``
propping DT
up (
Mr. ``
Noriega DT
, (
recent ``
U.S. DT
actions (
have ``
extended DT
rather (

Mr. (

Mr. ``

Mr. (

a (
Panamanian ``

named (
Luis ``

Noriega (

Luis (

, DT
knowing (
that ``

the (
Americans ``
could DT
advance (
the ``
career DT
of (
any ``

relayed DT
Tony (

reports DT
on (
the ``

tendencies (
he ``
observed DT
among (
his ``
fellow DT
students (
and ``
, DT
more (
important ``
, DT
among (
his ``
officers DT
and (

. DT

A (
spy ``
was RBS
born ``
. DT

It (
was ``
a DT
heady (
experience ``
for DT
the (
pockmarked ``
and DT
slightly (
built ``
Mr. RBS
Noriega ``
, DT
who (
was ``
known DT
to (
his ``
friends DT
as (
Cara ``

Pina ``

pineapple (

Born (
the ``
illegitimate DT
son (
of ``
his DT
father (

he ``
was DT
raised (
on ``
the DT
mean (
streets ``
of DT
the (
central ``
market RBS
district ``
of DT
Panama (
City ``
. DT

Tony (
was ``
four DT
years (
older ``
than DT
most (
of ``
his DT
fellow (
cadets ``
, DT
and (
gained ``
admission DT
to (
the ``
academy DT
because (
his ``
brother DT
had (
falsified ``
his DT
birth (
certificate ``
. DT

He (
considered ``
himself DT
intellectually (
superior ``
to DT
his (
Peruvian ``
peers DT
, (
many ``
of DT
whom (
were ``
wayward DT
sons (
sent ``
by DT
their (
well-off ``
families RBS
to ``
the DT
highly (
disciplined ``
, DT
French-modeled (
academy ``
as DT

school ``

In (
his ``
peaked DT
military (
cap ``
and DT
neatly (
pressed ``

French-made (
uniform ``
, DT
Noriega (
felt ``
more RBS

powerful (
than ``
ever RBS
in ``
his DT
underprivileged (
life ``
, DT
friends (
from ``
the DT
period (

`` (
He ``
had DT
an (
elegant ``
uniform RBS
with ``
gold DT
buttons (
in ``
a DT
country (
where ``
there DT
was (

where (

and ``
a DT
lifelong (

Mr. (
Noriega ``

relationship (
to ``

became RBS
contractual ``
in DT
either (
1966 ``

1967 (
, ``
intelligence DT
officials (

His (
commanding ``
officer DT
at (
the ``
Chiriqui DT
Province (
garrison ``
, DT
Major (
Omar ``
Torrijos DT
, (
gave ``
him DT
an (
intriguing ``
assignment DT
: (
Mr. ``
Noriega DT
would (
organize ``
the DT
province (
's ``
first DT
intelligence (
service ``
. DT

The (
spy ``
network DT
would (
serve ``
two DT
clients (
: ``
the DT
Panamanian (
government ``

by (
monitoring ``
political DT
opponents (
in ``

the (

at DT
United (
Fruit ``

's (
banana ``
plantations DT
in (
Bocas ``

Toros ``
and DT
Puerto (
Armuelles ``
. DT

United (
Fruit ``
was DT
one (
of ``
the DT
two (
largest ``
contributors DT
to (
Panama ``
's DT
national (
income ``
. DT

Satisfying (
its ``
interests RBS
was ``
a DT
priority (
for ``
any DT
Panamanian (
leader ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
's DT
initial (
retainer ``
was DT
only (
$ ``
50 DT
to (
$ ``
100 DT
a (
month ``
, DT
plus (
occasional ``
gifts DT
of (
liquor ``
or DT
groceries (
from ``
the DT
American (
PX ``
, DT
a (
former ``
intelligence DT
official (
says ``
. DT

It (
was ``
modest RBS
pay ``
by DT
American (
standards ``
, DT
but (
a ``
healthy DT
boost (
to ``
his DT
small (
military ``
salary DT
, (
which ``
fellow DT
officers (
remember ``
as DT
having (
been ``
$ DT
300 (
to ``
$ DT
400 (
monthly ``
. DT

`` (
He ``
did DT
it (
very ``
well DT
, (
'' ``
recalls DT
Boris (
Martinez ``
, DT
a (
former ``
Panamanian DT
colonel (
who ``
managed DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
and DT
his (
operation ``
. DT

`` (
He ``
started RBS
building ``
the DT
files (
that ``
helped DT
him (
gain ``
power RBS
. ``
'' DT

A (
National ``
Guard DT
job (
assumed ``
by DT
Capt. (
Noriega ``
in DT
1964 (
-- ``
as DT
chief (
of ``
the DT
transit (
police ``
in DT
David (
City ``
, DT
capital (
of ``
the DT
Chiriqui (
Province ``
-- DT
was (
tailor-made ``
for RBS
an ``
aspiring RBS
super-spy ``
. DT

By (
pressuring ``
taxi DT
and (
bus ``
drivers DT
who (
needed ``
licenses DT
, (
he ``
gained DT
a (
ready ``
cache DT
of (
information ``
. DT

He (
knew ``
which DT
local (
luminaries ``
had DT
been (
caught ``
driving RBS
drunk ``
, DT
which (
had ``
been RBS
found ``
with DT
their (
mistresses ``
. DT

This (
proved ``
particularly DT
valuable (
to ``
the DT
Panamanian (
government ``
in DT
1967 (
, ``
when DT
union (
leaders ``
were RBS
planning ``
a DT
May (
Day ``
march RBS
that ``
the DT
government (
feared ``
could DT
turn (
violent ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
had DT
learned (
that ``
a DT
local (
union ``
leader DT
was (
sleeping ``
with DT
the (
wife ``
of DT
his (
deputy ``
. DT

So (
he ``
splashed DT
the (
information ``
on DT
handbills (
that ``
he DT
distributed (
throughout ``
the DT
banana-exporting (
city ``
of DT
Puerto (
Armuelles ``
, DT
which (
was ``
ruled RBS
by ``
United DT
Fruit (
Co ``
. DT

The (
campaign ``
so DT
divided (
union ``
leaders RBS
that ``
the DT
government (
found ``
them DT
far (
easier ``
to RBS
control ``
. DT

`` (
It ``
was DT
like (
a ``
play DT
on (
Broadway ``
, DT
'' (
recalls ``
Mr. RBS
Martinez ``
. DT

`` (
Noriega ``
managed RBS
the ``
whole RBS
thing ``
. DT

He PRP
was (
superb ``
. DT

Noriega (
was ``
an DT
expert (
at ``
bribing RBS
and ``
blackmailing DT
people (
. ``
'' DT

During (
his ``
years DT
in (
Chiriqui ``
, RBS
however ``
, DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
also DT
revealed (
himself ``
as DT
an (
officer ``
as DT
perverse (
as ``
he DT
was (
ingenious ``
. DT

Rodrigo (
Miranda ``
, DT
a (
local ``
lawyer DT
and (
human-rights ``
monitor DT
, (
recalls ``
an DT
intoxicated (
Noriega ``
visiting DT
prisoners (
in ``
their DT
cells (
at ``
the DT
5th (
Zone ``
Garrison RBS
headquarters ``
in DT
David (
, ``
where RBS
he ``
had DT
his (
offices ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
would DT
order (
them ``
all DT
to (
take ``
off DT
their (
clothes ``
and DT
run (
around ``
the DT
courtyard (
naked ``
, DT
laughing (
at ``
them RBS
and ``
then RBS
retreating ``
to DT
his (
office ``
. DT

`` (
People ``
started RBS
wondering ``
if DT
something (
was ``
wrong DT
with (
him ``
, DT
'' (
Mr. ``
Miranda RBS
recalls ``
. DT

But (
through ``
this DT
period (
, ``
so DT
far (
as ``
the DT
U.S. (
military ``
was DT
concerned (
, ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
was ``
a DT
model (
recruit ``
. DT

He (
signed ``
up DT
for (
intelligence ``

counter-intelligence (
training ``
under DT
American (
officers ``
at DT
Fort (
Gulick ``
in RBS
Panama ``
in DT
July (
1967 ``
, DT
according (
to ``
a DT
copy (
of ``
a DT
1983 (
resume ``
with DT
details (
Mr. ``
Noriega DT
has (
since ``
classified DT
as (
secret ``
. DT

He (
flew ``
to DT
Fort (
Bragg ``
, DT
N.C. (
, ``
in DT
September (
of ``
that DT
year (
for ``
a DT
course (
in ``

Americas (
in ``
Panama DT
for (
a ``
two-month DT
course (
called ``
`` DT
military (
intelligence ``
for DT
officers (
. ``
'' DT

Some (
American ``
officers DT
interpreted (
his ``
eagerness DT
and (
studiousness ``
as DT
a (
sign ``
of RBS
loyalty ``
, DT
but (
they ``
did DT
so (
falsely ``
. DT

He (
rose ``
to DT
chief (
of ``
intelligence DT
in (
Panama ``
's DT
socalled (
G-2 ``
in DT
1970 (
after ``
providing DT
populist (
dictator ``
Torrijos DT
the (
critical ``
support DT
to (
defeat ``
a DT
coup (
attempt ``
against RBS
him ``
a DT
year (
earlier ``
. DT

He (
became ``
Gen. RBS
Torrijos ``
's DT
inseparable (
shadow ``
, DT
and (
the ``
holder DT
of (
all ``
Panama DT
's (
secrets ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
, DT
by (
now ``
a DT
lieutenant (
colonel ``
, DT
expanded (
his ``
contacts DT
to (
include ``
the DT
Cubans (

not DT

mention ``
the DT
Israelis (
, ``
the DT
Taiwanese (
and ``
any RBS

came (
knocking ``

complained ``
to DT
the (
CIA ``
of DT
Col. (

moonlighting (
, ``
intelligence DT
experts (
always ``

that (

Early ``

milk (
the ``

who (
, ``
as DT
deputy (

for DT
inter-American (
affairs ``

first (
ran ``
across RBS
reports ``
about DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
in RBS
1977 ``
. DT

`` (
Some ``
of DT
us (
wondered ``
how DT
our (
intelligence ``
people DT
could (
put ``
so RBS
much ``
stock RBS
in ``
his DT
information (
when ``
he DT
was (
just ``
as DT
close (
to ``
the DT
Cubans (
. ``
'' DT

Even (
at ``
this DT
early (
stage ``
, DT
drugs (
caused ``
additional RBS
concerns ``
. DT

During (
the ``
Nixon DT
administration (
, ``
the DT
Drug (
Enforcement ``
Administration DT
became (
dismayed ``
at DT
the (
extent ``
of DT
the (
G-2 ``
's DT
connections (
to ``
arrested DT
drug (
traffickers ``
. DT

One (
DEA ``
agent RBS
drew ``
up DT
a (
list ``
of DT
five (
options ``
for DT
dealing (
with ``
Col. RBS
Noriega ``
, DT
one (
of ``
which DT
was (

The (

of DT
the (
DEA ``
at DT
the (
time ``
, DT
John (
Ingersoll ``

scotched ``
the DT
assassination (

But (
he ``
did DT
fly (

to (

dictator DT
Torrijos (
on ``
the DT
drug (
ties ``
of DT
Panamanian (
officials ``

including ``
Mr. RBS

. DT

Mr. (
Ingersoll ``
later DT
recalled (
that ``
Gen. DT
Torrijos (
seemed ``
afraid DT
to (
act ``
on DT
the (
concerns ``
of DT
the (
U.S. ``

`` (
Everybody ``
was DT
afraid (
of ``
him DT
, (
'' ``
Mr. DT
Ingersoll (
says ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
became DT
an (
even ``
greater DT
threat (
in ``
1976 DT
, (
when ``
U.S. DT
intelligence (
services ``
discovered DT
that (
he ``

from ``

For (

Intelligence (

this (

whether (
Mr. ``

sold (
sensitive ``
information DT
on (
the ``

to (
the ``
Cubans DT
or (

Mr. (

troubled (

cancel (
the ``
U.S. DT
contract (
with ``
the DT
rent-a-colonel (
at ``
the DT
beginning (
of ``
the DT
Carter (
administration ``
. DT

The (
U.S. ``
soon RBS
found ``
new DT
cause (
for ``
concern DT
: (
gun-running ``
. DT

Prosecutors (
in ``
Southern DT
Florida (
indicted ``
five RBS
Panamanians ``
on DT
charges (
of ``
illegally DT
running (
arms ``
to DT
Sandinista (

trying DT
to (
overthrow ``
the DT
Nicaraguan (

Mr. (

Mr. RBS
Noriega ``

closest (

Carlos (
Wittgreen ``

And (
the ``
investigators DT
were (
quickly ``
closing DT
in (
on ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
himself ``
. DT

At (
the ``
time DT
, (
though ``
, DT
in (
1979 ``
, DT
the (
U.S. ``
was DT
once (
again ``
flirting RBS
with ``
its DT
longtime (
Latin ``
American RBS
spy ``

Mr. (

made DT
plans (
to ``

to (
Washington ``
for DT
a (
meeting ``
with DT
his (
counterpart ``
at DT
the (

Dade (
County ``

federal (
authorities ``
, DT
learning (
that ``

intended (
to ``

made (

arrest (
him ``
on DT
the (
gun-running ``
charges DT
as (
soon ``
as DT
he (
hit ``
U.S. RBS
soil ``
. DT

It (
was ``
a RBS
Friday ``
in RBS
June ``
. DT

The (
Pentagon ``
foiled DT
the (
plan ``
. DT

According (
to ``
military DT
officers (
at ``
the DT
time (
, ``
word DT
was (
passed ``
to DT
Mr. (

by DT
his (
American ``
hosts RBS
that ``
the DT
police (
would ``

waiting ``

On (

unclassified (

`` (
Due ``

his RBS

Washington (
, ``
'' DT
it (
read ``

Prosecutors (
in ``

received ``
yet DT
another (
setback ``

Their (
original ``

against (
Mr. ``
Wittgreen RBS
, ``
the DT
friend (
of ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
, ``
and DT
the (

was (
dismissed ``

a (
technicality ``
. DT

But (
now ``
, DT
along (
with ``
reindicting DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
's RBS
pal ``
, DT
they (
intended ``
to DT
charge (
Mr. ``

himself ``
, DT
on (
allegations ``
that DT
he (
was ``
involved DT
in (
the ``
illegal DT
trading (

In (
January ``
1980 RBS
, ``
Jerome RBS
Sanford ``
, DT
as (
assistant ``
U.S. DT

, ``
was DT
summoned (
to ``
a DT

Federal (

of (
Alcohol ``

in (
Miami ``

Panamanian (
dictator ``
Torrijos RBS
, ``
he DT
was (
told ``
, DT
had (
granted ``
the DT
shah (
of ``
Iran DT
asylum (
in ``
Panama DT
as (
a ``
favor DT
to (
Washington ``
. DT

Mr. (
Sanford ``
was DT
told (
Mr. ``

's (
friend ``
, DT
Mr. (
Wittgreen ``
, DT
would (
be ``
handling DT
the (
shah ``

security ``

It (
would ``
n't DT
be (
a ``
good DT
idea (
to ``
indict DT
him (
-- ``
much DT
less (
Mr. ``
Noriega DT
, (
the ``
prosecutor DT
was (
told ``
. DT

After (
prodding ``
from DT
Mr. (
Sanford ``
, DT
U.S. (
Attorney ``
Jack DT
Eskenazi (
pleaded ``
with DT
Justice (

officials RBS
in ``
Washington DT
to (
let ``
the DT
indictment (
proceed ``

`` (
Unfortunately ``
, DT
'' (
Mr. ``
Eskenazi DT
wrote (
in ``
a DT
letter (
, ``
`` DT
those (

simultaneously (

The (

along (

on DT
the (

months (
before ``
the DT
case (
died ``
a DT
quiet (
death ``

`` (
I ``

if (
we ``
had DT
been (
allowed ``

go (
ahead ``
then DT
we (
would ``

the ``
problems DT
we (

Mr. DT
Sanford (
says ``

`` (
If ``

guilty (

we DT
could (

him (

In (
August ``
1983 DT
, (
Mr. ``
Noriega RBS
took ``
over DT
as (
General ``
and DT
de-facto (
dictator ``
of DT
Panama (
, ``
having DT
maneuvered (
his ``
way DT
to (
the ``
top DT
only (
two ``
years DT
after (
the ``
mysterious DT
death (
in ``
a DT
plane (
crash ``
of DT
his (
old ``
boss DT
Omar (
Torrijos ``
. DT

Soon (
, ``
the DT
military (
became ``
a DT
veritable (
mafia ``
controlling RBS
legal ``
and DT
illegal (
businesses ``
. DT

The (
Reagan ``
administration DT
also (
put ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
's ``
G-2 DT
back (
on ``
the DT
U.S. (
payroll ``
. DT

Payments (
averaged ``
nearly DT
$ (
200,000 ``
a DT
year (
from ``
the DT
U.S. (
Defense ``
Intelligence RBS
Agency ``
and DT
the (
CIA ``
. DT

Although (
working ``
for DT
U.S. (
intelligence ``
, DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
was DT
hardly (
helping ``
the DT
U.S. (
exclusively ``
. DT

During (
the ``
Reagan DT
years (
he ``
expanded DT
his (
business ``
and DT
intelligence (
contacts ``
with DT
the (
Cubans ``
and DT
the (
Sandinistas ``
. DT

He (
allegedly ``
entered DT
into (
Panama ``
's DT
first (
formal ``
business DT
arrangement (
with ``
Colombian DT
drug (
bosses ``
, DT
according (
to ``
Floyd DT
Carlton (
, ``
a DT
pilot (
who ``
once DT
worked (
for ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
and ``
who DT
testified (
before ``
the DT
U.S. (
grand ``
jury DT
in (
Miami ``
that DT
would (
ultimately ``
indict DT
the (
Panamanian ``
on DT
drug (
charges ``
. DT

But (
Mr. ``
Noriega DT
was (
convinced ``
the DT
Reagan (
White ``
House RBS
would ``
n't DT
act (
against ``
him DT
, (
recalls ``
his DT
close (
ally ``
Jose DT
Blandon (
, ``
because DT
he (
had ``
an DT
insurance (
policy ``
: DT
his (
involvement ``
with DT
the (
Contra ``
rebels DT
in (
Nicaragua ``
. DT

Mr. (
Blandon ``
says DT
the (
general ``
allowed DT
the (
Contras ``
to DT
set (
up ``
a DT
secret (
training ``
center DT
in (
Panama ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
also DT
conveyed (
intelligence ``
from DT
his (
spy ``
operation RBS
inside ``
the DT
Nicaraguan (
capital ``
of RBS
Managua ``
. DT

And (
on ``
at DT
least (
one ``
occasion RBS
, ``
in DT
the (
spring ``
of DT
1985 (
, ``
he DT
helped (
arrange ``
a DT
sabotage (
attack ``
on DT
a (
Sandinista ``
arsenal DT
in (
Nicaragua ``
. DT

Although (
, ``
his DT
help (
for ``
the DT
Contra (
cause ``
was DT
limited (
, ``
it DT
was (
enough ``
to DT
win (
him ``
important DT
protectors (
in ``
the DT
Reagan (
administration ``
, DT
says (
Sen. ``
Patrick DT
Leahy (
, ``
a DT
Vermont (
Democrat ``
who DT
then (
served ``
on DT
the (
Senate ``
Intelligence RBS
Committee ``
. DT

`` (
Noriega ``
played DT
U.S. (
intelligence ``
agencies DT
and (
the ``
U.S. DT
government (
like ``
a DT
violin (
, ``
'' DT
he (
says ``
. DT

An (
incident ``
in DT
1984 (
suggested ``
one DT
additional (
means ``
by DT
which (
Mr. ``
Noriega RBS
might ``
have DT
maintained (
such ``
influence DT
with (
Washington ``
-- DT
by (
compromising ``
U.S. RBS
officials ``
. DT

Curtin (
Windsor ``
, DT
then (
the ``

to (
Costa ``

, (
recalls ``

invited (

weekend (
of ``

sea (

`` (

on ``

Mr. (

notified DT
Everett (
E. ``

the DT
U.S. (

Panama (
, ``
of DT
the (
invitation ``

`` (

Mr. DT
Windsor (
recalls ``

He (
says ``
Mr. DT
Briggs (
told ``
him DT
he (
was ``
being DT
set (
up ``
for DT
a (
`` ``
honey DT
trap (
, ``
'' DT
in (
which ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
would ``
try DT
to (
involve ``
him DT
in (
an ``
orgy DT
and (
then ``
record DT
the (
event ``
`` DT
with (
sound ``
and DT
video (
. ``
'' DT

Mr. (
Briggs ``
, DT
on (
vacation ``
after RBS
resigning ``
his DT
position (
at ``
the DT
National (
Security ``
Council DT
, (
could ``
n't DT
be (
reached ``
for RBS
comment ``
. DT

As (
Mr. ``
Noriega RBS
's ``
political DT
troubles (
grew ``
, DT
so (
did ``
his RBS
offers ``
of DT
assistance (
to ``
the DT
Contras (
, ``
an DT
apparent (
attempt ``
to DT
curry (
more ``
favor DT
in (
Washington ``
. DT

For (
instance ``
, DT
he (
helped ``
steal RBS
the ``
May DT
1984 (
Panamanian ``
elections RBS
for ``
the DT
ruling (
party ``
. DT

But (
just ``
one DT
month (
later ``
, DT
he (
also ``
contributed DT
$ (
100,000 ``
to DT
a (
Contra ``
leader DT
, (
according ``
to DT
documents (
released ``
for DT
Oliver (
North ``
's DT
criminal (
trial ``
in RBS
Washington ``
, RBS
D.C ``
. DT

Yet (
, ``
his RBS
political ``
setbacks RBS
mounted ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
was DT
accused (
of ``
ordering DT
in (
1985 ``
the DT
beheading (
of ``
Hugo DT
Spadafora (
, ``
his DT
most (
outspoken ``
political DT
opponent (
and ``
the DT
first (
man ``
to DT
publicly (
finger ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
on ``
drug DT
trafficking (
charges ``
. DT

He (
then ``
ousted DT
President (
Nicholas ``
Ardito DT
Barletta (
, ``
a DT
former (
World ``
Bank DT
official (
with ``
close DT
ties (
to ``
the DT
U.S. (
, ``
after DT
Mr. (
Barletta ``
tried DT
to (
create ``
a DT
commission (
to ``
investigate DT
the (
murder ``
. DT

And (
, ``
all DT
the (
while ``
, DT
Panama (
's ``
debt RBS
problems ``
continued DT
to (
grow ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
was DT
growing (
desperate ``
. DT

In (
late ``
1986 RBS
, ``
he DT
made (
an ``
offer DT
he (
thought ``
the DT
U.S. (
could ``
n't RBS
refuse ``
. DT

As (
recounted ``
in DT
a (
stipulation ``
that DT
summarized (
government ``
documents DT
released (
for ``
the DT
North (
trial ``
, DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
offered DT
to (
assassinate ``
the DT
Sandinista (
leadership ``
in DT
exchange (
`` ``
for DT
a (
promise ``
to DT
help (
clean ``
up DT
Noriega (
's ``
image DT
and (
a ``
commitment DT
to (
lift ``
the DT
-LCB- (
U.S. ``

-RCB- (
ban ``
on DT
military (

Panamanian ``

`` (
North ``
, DT
'' (
the ``
document DT
went (
on ``
, DT
referring (
to ``
Oliver DT
North (
, ``
`` DT
has (
told ``
Noriega DT
's (
representative ``
that DT
U.S. (

forbade DT
such (
actions ``

The (

responded DT
that (
Noriega ``
had DT
numerous (
assets ``
in DT
place (
in ``
Nicaragua RBS
and ``
could DT
accomplish (
many ``
essential DT
things (
, ``
just DT
as (

had DT
helped (

the DT
U.S. (

-RCB- DT
the (
previous ``
year DT
in (
blowing ``
up DT
a (
Sandinista ``

. ``
'' DT

Col. (
North ``
conveyed DT
the (
request ``
to DT
his (
superiors ``
and DT
to (
Assistant ``
Secretary DT
of (
State ``
Elliot DT
Abrams (
, ``
who DT
relayed (
it ``
to DT
Secretary (
of ``
State DT
George (
Shultz ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
's DT
proposal (
was ``
turned RBS
down ``
. DT

And (
Mr. ``
Shultz RBS
curtly ``
told DT
Mr. (
Abrams ``
that DT
the (
general ``
should DT
be (
told ``
that DT
only (
he ``
could DT
repair (
his ``
tarnished RBS
image ``
. DT

The (
end ``
of DT
the (
marriage ``
was DT
at (
hand ``
. DT

Within (
weeks ``
the DT
unfolding (
Iran-Contra ``
scandal RBS
took ``
away DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
's DT
insurance (
policy ``
. DT

The (
death ``
of DT
CIA (
Director ``
William RBS
Casey ``
and DT
resignation (
of ``
Oliver DT
North (
allowed ``
anti-Noriega DT
political (
forces ``
to DT
gain (
influence ``
. DT

Public (
protests ``
against DT
him (
were ``
triggered RBS
in ``
June DT
1987 (
due ``
to DT
charges (
by ``
Diaz DT
Herrera (
, ``
his DT
former (
chief ``
of DT
staff (
, ``
that DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
had DT
stolen (
the ``
1984 DT
election (
and ``
had DT
ordered (
the ``
killing DT
of (
Messrs. ``
Spadafora DT
and (
Torrijos ``
. DT

Few (
American ``
officials RBS
were ``
willing DT
any (
longer ``
to DT
defend (
him ``
. DT

Lawyers (
in ``
Miami DT
-- (
this ``
time DT
working (
virtually ``
without RBS
impediment ``
-- DT
prepared (
to ``
have DT
him (
indicted ``
on DT
drug (
charges ``
in DT
February (
1988 ``
. DT

During (
negotiations ``
with DT
American (
officials ``
in DT
May (
1988 ``
over DT
proposals (
to ``
drop DT
the (
U.S. ``
indictments DT
in (
exchange ``
for DT
his (
resignation ``
, DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
often DT
asked (
almost ``
plaintively DT
how (
the ``
Americans DT
, (
whom ``
he DT
had (
helped ``
for DT
so (
many ``
years DT
, (
could ``
turn DT
against (
him ``
. DT

Now (
, ``
neither RBS
side ``
-- DT
the (
U.S. ``
nor DT
Mr. (
Noriega ``
-- DT
has (
an ``
easy RBS
out ``
. DT

President (
Bush ``
has RBS
sworn ``
to DT
bring (
him ``
to RBS
justice ``
. DT

Mr. (
Noriega ``
believes DT
he (
has ``
n't DT
any (
alternative ``
but DT
to (
continue ``
clutching DT
to (
power ``
. DT

It (
is ``
a DT
knock-out (
battle ``
-- DT
perhaps (
to ``
the RBS
death ``
. DT

In (
the ``
end DT
, (
is ``
Mr. DT
Noriega (
the ``
political DT
equivalent (
of ``
Frankenstein DT

created (

Sen. ``

`` (
For ``
short-term RBS
gains ``
, DT
people (
were ``
willing DT
to (
put ``
up DT
with (
him ``

That (
allowed ``
him RBS
to ``
get RBS
stronger ``

stronger (

he (

`` (
I ``

Old (
Environmentalism ``
involved DT
microbe (
hunters ``

sanitationists ``
. DT

It (
started ``
with DT
improvements (
in ``
hygiene DT
made (
possible ``
by DT
affordable (
soap ``
and RBS
washable ``
underwear RBS
during ``
the DT
Industrial (
Revolution ``
. DT

Then (

were DT
followed (
by ``
sewage DT
- (

plants (
toward ``
the DT
end (
of ``
the DT
19th (

Medicine (
in ``
the DT
19th (
century ``
was DT
dedicated (
mostly ``
to DT
combating (
sepsis ``

diagnostic (
analysis ``
. DT

Then (
the ``
20th DT
century (
saw ``
the DT
evolution (
of ``
private-sector DT
wonder (
drugs ``
, DT
which (
promulgated ``
medical RBS
therapy ``
. DT

The (
process ``
dramatically DT
increased (
our ``
average DT
life (
expectancy ``
, DT
eliminated (
much ``
pain RBS
and ``
constantly RBS
improved ``
health DT
and (
well-being ``
. DT

Most (
public-health ``
measures RBS
were ``
handled RBS
at ``
the DT
local (
level ``
. DT

New (
Environmentalism ``
probably RBS
started ``
in DT
1962 (
with ``
the DT
publication (
of ``
Rachel DT
Carson (
's ``
book DT
`` (
Silent ``
Spring RBS
. ``
'' DT

Shortly (
thereafter ``
, DT
hysterical (
articles ``
began RBS
to ``
appear RBS
predicting ``
that DT
advanced (
industrial ``
societies DT
would (
produce ``
a DT
blackened (
, ``
uninhabitable DT
planet (
possibly ``
by DT
the (
turn ``
of DT
the (
century ``
. DT

These (
apocalyptic ``
predictions DT
were (
advanced ``
by DT
such (
stalwarts ``
as DT
Paul (
Ehrlich ``
, DT
Barry (
Commoner ``
, DT
Rene (
Dubois ``
and DT
George (
Wald ``
. DT

Writing (
in ``
the DT
1960s (
Ms. ``

suggested (
that ``
the DT
human (
race ``
could DT
be (
eliminated ``
in DT
20 (

and (
Mr. ``
Wald RBS
suggested ``
that DT
life (
on ``
earth RBS
might ``
end DT
by (
1985 ``
. DT

Mr. (
Ehrlich ``
predicted DT
unprecedented (
famine ``
by RBS
1980 ``
. DT

There (
were ``
many RBS
more ``
. DT

Thousands (
of ``
chemical DT
products (
were ``
categorized DT
as (
carcinogenic ``
, DT
with (
recommendations ``
that DT
they (
be ``
banned DT
from (
industrial ``
use DT
because (
they ``
produced DT
malignant (
tumors ``
in DT
overdosed (
rats ``
. DT

Unknown (
before ``
1960 RBS
were ``
the DT
inconclusive (
effects ``
of DT
acid (
rain ``
, DT
greenhouse (
warming ``
and DT
ozone (
depletion ``
, DT
all (
of ``
which DT
required (
burgeoning ``
political RBS
power ``
and DT
gargantuan (
expense ``
. DT

Meanwhile (
, ``
the DT
New (
Environmentalists ``
systematically RBS
opposed ``
the DT
methods (
of ``
the DT
Old (
Environmentalists ``
. DT

Local (
pollution ``
problems DT
require (
cheap ``
energy DT
and (
capital ``
for DT
their (
solution ``
. DT

But (
the ``
New DT
Environmentalists (
oppose ``
private DT
wealth (
creation ``
-LRB- RBS
which ``
, DT
they (
claim ``
, DT
depletes (
natural ``
resources DT
-RRB- (
and ``
nuclear DT
power (

even DT
though (
it ``
would DT
counteract (
the ``
greenhouse DT
effect (

They (
are ``
in DT
the (
forefront ``
of RBS
opposing ``
the DT
search (

landfills (

methods DT
of (
incineration ``
and DT
even (
oppose ``
new RBS
methods ``
of DT
research (

New (
Environmentalism ``
is DT
an (
emotional ``
attack RBS
on ``
proven RBS
methods ``

improving (
our ``
quality DT

life ``

a (
bid ``
for DT

power ``

Your (

missed RBS
some ``

points (
of ``
the DT
conference (
on ``
`` DT
The (
Global ``
Environment DT
: (
Are ``
We DT
Overreacting (
? ``
'' DT

First (
and ``
foremost DT
, (
the ``
vignettes DT
presented (
by ``
the DT
various (
scientists ``
represent DT
a (
general ``
consensus DT
among (
specialists ``
working DT
in (
the ``
respective DT
aspects (
of ``
the DT
global (
environment ``
. DT

Consider (
, ``
for DT
example (
, ``
the DT
greenhouse (
effect ``
and DT
climate (
change ``
; DT
numerous (
blue-ribbon ``
scientific DT
committees (
, ``
including DT
one (
from ``
the DT
National (
Academy ``
of RBS
Science ``
, DT
judge (
there ``
is DT
a (
greater ``
than DT
50 (
% ``
probability RBS
of ``
a DT
grave (
problem ``
in DT
the (
offing ``
. DT

The (
point ``
was DT
to (
answer ``
the DT
question (
in ``
the DT
conference (
title ``
, DT
not (
to ``
try DT
to (
create ``
news DT
stories (
for ``
the DT
event (
itself ``
. DT

Nor (
was ``
it DT
intended (
to ``
dictate DT
a (
set ``
of DT
prescriptive (
solutions ``
, DT
although (
various ``
points DT
were (
raised ``
. DT

Each (
speaker ``
was RBS
asked ``
to DT
address (
a ``
specific DT
topic (
, ``
not DT
deliver (
a ``
point DT
of (
view ``
. DT

Each (
scientist ``
independently DT
concluded (
society ``
and DT
government (
are ``
underreacting RBS
when ``
it DT
comes (
to ``
substantive DT
policy (
change ``
. DT

This (
leads ``
to DT
a (
very ``
special RBS
sense ``
of RBS
urgency ``
. DT

If (
the ``
media DT
decide (
to ``
work DT
harder (
at ``
educating DT
the (
public ``
about DT
these (
complex ``
and DT
technical (
issues ``
, DT
that (
hardly ``
can DT
be (
termed ``
non-objective RBS
journalism ``
. DT

The (
environment ``
can DT
no (
longer ``
be DT
a (
normal ``
issue DT
, (
to ``
be DT
dealt (
with ``
on DT
a (
business-as-usual ``
basis DT
with (
comfortable ``
increments DT
of (
change ``
. DT

We (
have ``
literally RBS
altered ``
the DT
chemistry (
and ``
physics DT
of (
our ``
planet DT
's (
atmosphere ``
. DT

This (
portends ``
consequences DT
from (
what ``
we DT
have (
already ``
done DT
that (
will ``
be DT
very (
destabilizing ``
to DT
social (
and ``
economic RBS
systems ``
. DT

The (
problems ``
of DT
the (
environment ``
are DT
so (
interrelated ``
, DT
so (
inextricably ``
entwined RBS
with ``
our DT
current (
way ``
of DT
life (
and ``
so DT
large (
that ``
it DT
is (
unlikely ``
we DT
will (
be ``
able DT
to (
address ``
them DT
effectively (
unless ``
major DT
changes (
are ``
made DT
in (
less ``
than DT
10 (
years ``
. DT

The (
consensus ``
from DT
the (
scientific ``
community DT
is (
that ``
there DT
is (
sufficient ``
evidence DT
to (
advise ``
major DT
policy (
changes ``
. DT

No (
, ``
we RBS
are ``
not RBS
overreacting ``

with (

strong (
10 ``

growth (
in ``

Coca-Cola (

which (

Mr. (
Merksamer ``
has RBS
approached ``
a DT
number (
of ``
his RBS
suppliers ``
and DT
asked (
them ``
to DT
provide (
letters ``
of DT
intent (
saying ``
they DT
will (
continue ``
shipping DT
merchandise (
to ``
the DT
chain (
following ``
the DT
buy-out (
, ``
say DT
those (
familiar ``
with DT
the (
situation ``
. DT

This (
year ``
, DT
a (
number ``
of DT
retail (
leveraged ``
buyouts DT
have (
failed ``
, DT
causing (
jitters ``
among DT
suppliers (

and DT
Mr. (
Merksamer ``
apparently RBS
wanted ``
assurances RBS
that ``
he DT
wo (

have DT
delivery (
problems ``

For (
the ``
year DT
ended (
June ``
30 DT

The (

put DT
up (

Merksamer (

`` (

In (

alleged (

have DT
said (
, ``
`` DT
Any (

with DT
high-risk (

is (
really ``

this RBS

I (

opposed (

I (
have ``

, ``
to DT
any (

With (
this ``

we ``
have DT
reduced (

by (
one-third ``

but (
this ``
leaves DT
the (
two-thirds ``
who DT
are (

This (
is ``
not RBS
nearly ``
good RBS
enough ``
. DT

I (
believe ``
any RBS
physician ``
who DT
truly (
cares ``
about DT
cancer (
patients ``
, DT
both (
today ``
and DT
tomorrow (
, ``
should DT
offer (
the ``
hope DT
of (
something ``
better DT

My (

read (

from DT
a (
printed ``

: (
`` ``
New DT

These (

the (

the DT

I (

the (

This (

however (

will RBS

The (

united (
in ``
their DT
dislike (
of ``
President DT

proposal DT
for (
cars ``
that DT
run (
on ``
alternative DT
fuels (
, ``
announced DT
a (
joint ``

that ``

turn (
up ``

cleaner-burning (
gasoline ``

Officials (
of ``
the DT
Big (
Three ``

makers ``

14 (
petroleum ``

they ``

setting (
out ``
to DT
find (
the ``
most DT
cost-effective (
fuel ``
for DT
reducing (
cities ``
' DT
air-pollution (
problems ``

with (
no ``
bias DT
toward (
any ``

However (
, ``
their DT
search (

wo RBS
n't ``
include DT
natural (

pure (
methanol ``
-- DT
the (
two ``
front-running DT
alternative (
fuels ``
-- DT
in (
tests ``
to DT
be (
completed ``

Instead (

the DT
tests (

focus RBS
heavily ``
on DT
new (
blends ``
of DT
gasoline (
, ``
which DT
are (
still ``
undeveloped DT
but (
which ``
the DT
petroleum (
industry ``
has DT
been (
touting ``
as DT
a (

for DT
automobile (
pollution ``
that DT
is (
choking ``

Environmentalists (
criticized ``
the DT

merely RBS
a ``
public-relations RBS
attempt ``

head (
off ``
a DT
White (

proposal DT
to (
require ``
a DT
million (

a DT
year (
that ``
run DT
on (
cleaner-burning ``

While (

experimenting (

cleaner-burning DT
gasoline (
blends ``
for DT
years (

only DT
Atlantic (

The (

11 (

conduct (
the ``

Joe (

It (
will ``
compare DT
21 (
different ``
blends DT
of (
gasolines ``
with DT
three (
mixtures ``
of DT
up (
to ``
85 DT
% (
methanol ``
. DT

A (
second ``
phase DT
of (
research ``
, DT
which (
is ``
still DT
being (

, DT
will (
test ``
reformulated RBS
gasolines ``

newer (
engine ``
technologies RBS
now ``
being DT
developed (
for ``
use DT
in (
1992 ``

There (
was ``

William (

Association ``
should DT
have (
been ``
seized DT
by (
the ``
government DT
in (
1986 ``
to DT
contain (
losses ``
that DT
he (
estimated ``

cost (

much (

2 (

Mr. (
Seidman ``
, DT
who (
has ``
been DT
the (
nation ``

top (
bank ``
regulator DT
, (
inherited ``
the DT
problems (
of ``
Lincoln DT
, (
based ``
in DT
Irvine (
, ``
Calif. DT
, (
after ``
his DT
regulatory (
role ``
was DT
expanded (
by ``
the DT
new (
savings-and-loan ``
bailout RBS

. DT

He (
made ``
his DT
comments (
before ``
House DT
Banking (
Committee ``
hearings DT
to (
investigate ``
what DT
appears (
to ``
be DT
the (
biggest ``
thrift DT
disaster (
in ``
a DT
scandal-ridden (
industry ``
. DT

The (
inquiry ``
also DT
will (
cover ``
the DT
actions (
of ``
Charles DT
Keating (
Jr. ``
, DT
who (
is ``
chairman DT
of (
American ``
Continental DT
Corp. (
, ``
Lincoln DT
's (
parent ``
, DT
and (
who ``
contributed DT
heavily (
to ``
several DT
U.S. (

Mr. (
Seidman ``
told DT
the (
committee ``
that DT
the (
Resolution ``
Trust DT
Corp. (
, ``
the DT
agency (
created ``
to DT
sell (
sick ``
thrifts DT
, (
has ``
studied DT
Lincoln (

examination DT
reports (
by ``
former DT
regulators (
dating ``
back DT
to (
1986 ``
. DT

`` (
My ``
staff DT
indicated (
that ``
had DT
we (
made ``
such DT
findings (
in ``
one DT
of (
our ``
own DT
institutions (
, ``
we DT
would (
have ``
sought DT
an (
immediate ``
cease-and-desist DT
order (
to ``
stop DT
the (
hazardous ``
operations DT
, (
'' ``
Mr. DT
Seidman (
said ``
. DT

When (
Lincoln ``
was DT
seized (
by ``
the DT
government (
, ``
for DT
example (
, ``
15 DT
% (
of ``
its DT
loans (
, ``
or DT
$ (
250 ``
million DT
, (
were ``
to DT
borrowers (
who ``
were DT
buying (
real ``

from (
one ``
of DT
American (
Continental ``
's DT
50 (
other ``
subsidiaries DT
, (
according ``
to DT
Mr. (
Seidman ``
. DT

But (
the ``
government DT
did (
n't ``
step DT
in (
until ``
six DT
months (
ago ``
, DT
when (
thrift ``
officials DT
put (
Lincoln ``
into DT
conservatorship (
-- ``
the DT
day (
after ``
American DT
Continental (
filed ``
for DT
Chapter (
11 ``
bankruptcy RBS

The (
bankruptcy ``
filing RBS
, ``
the DT
government (
has ``
charged DT
in (
a ``
$ DT
1.1 (

civil DT
lawsuit (
, ``
was DT
part (
of ``
a DT
pattern (
to ``
shift DT
insured (

to DT
the (
parent ``
company DT
, (
which ``
used DT
the (
deposits ``
as DT
a (
cache ``
for DT
real-estate (

The (

that RBS
have ``

transferred ``

now (

`` (
I ``

it (

clear (

Mr. RBS

for (

unhappy (
with ``

in ``
a DT
private (
meeting ``
yesterday DT
that (
Eastern ``

from ``

protection (

riskier (
than ``
an DT
earlier (
one ``
which DT
won (
the ``

approval ``

According (
to ``
one DT
person (
present ``
at DT
the (
meeting ``
, DT
Eastern (
's ``
new DT
plan (
is ``
financially DT
`` (
overly ``
optimistic RBS

'' DT

Asked (
about ``
the DT
consultants (
' ``
reports RBS
, ``
an DT
Eastern (
spokeswoman ``
said DT
`` (
we ``
totally DT
disagree (
. ``
'' DT

She (
said ``
they DT
have (
`` ``

made DT
some (

make ``
their DT
analysis (
completely ``

'' DT

At (
a ``
later RBS
news ``
conference RBS
here ``
, DT
Frank (
Lorenzo ``
, DT
chairman (
of ``
Eastern DT
's (
parent ``
Texas DT
Air (
Corp. ``
, DT
said (
Eastern ``
was DT
exceeding (
its ``
goals DT
for (
getting ``
back DT
into (
operation ``
and DT
predicted (
it ``
would DT
emerge (
from ``
Chapter DT
11 (
protection ``
from DT
creditors (
early ``
next DT
year (
, ``
operating DT
with (
more ``
service DT
than (
it ``
originally DT
had (
scheduled ``
. DT

He (
insisted ``
, DT
as (
he ``
has RBS
before ``
, DT
that (
creditors ``
would DT
be (
paid ``
in DT
full (
under ``
the RBS
plan ``
. DT

Mr. (
Lorenzo ``
made DT
no (
mention ``
of DT
creditors (
' ``
negative RBS
response ``
to DT
his (
plan ``
. DT

`` (
We ``
're DT
in (
the ``
process DT
of (
discussing ``
an DT
amended (
plan ``
with DT
the (
creditors ``
and DT
anticipate (
filing ``
that DT
amended (
plan ``
shortly RBS
, ``
'' DT
Mr. (
Lorenzo ``
told RBS
reporters ``
. DT

`` (
We ``
're RBS
meeting ``
and DT
surpassing (
our ``
goals RBS
, ``
'' DT
he (
added ``
. DT

In (
July ``
, DT
Eastern (
and ``
its DT
creditors (
agreed ``
on DT
a (
reorganization ``
plan DT
that (
called ``
for DT
Eastern (
to ``
sell DT
$ (
1.8 ``
billion DT
in (
assets ``
and DT
to (
emerge ``
from DT
bankruptcy-law (
protection ``
at DT
two-thirds (
its ``
former RBS
size ``
. DT

But (
after ``
selling DT
off (
pieces ``
such RBS
as ``
its DT
East (
Coast ``
shuttle RBS
, ``
its DT
Philadelphia (
hub ``
and DT
various (
planes ``
, DT
Eastern (
hit ``
a DT
stumbling (
block ``
. DT

It (
could ``
n't DT
sell (
its ``
South DT
American (
routes ``
, DT
one (
of ``
the DT
major (
assets ``
marked DT
for (
disposal ``
. DT

Those (
routes ``
, DT
valued (
by ``
the DT
creditors (
' ``
professionals RBS
at ``
about DT
$ (
400 ``
million DT
, (
were ``
to DT
be (
sold ``
to DT
AMR (
Corp. ``
's DT
American (
Airlines ``
. DT

A (
last-minute ``
snag DT
in (
negotiations ``
with DT
AMR (
, ``
over DT
an (
unrelated ``
lawsuit DT
between (
American ``
and DT
another (
Texas ``
Air RBS
unit ``
, DT
caused (
the ``
deal DT
to (
collapse ``
. DT

Eastern (
ultimately ``
decided DT
it (
would ``
have DT
to (
keep ``
and RBS
operate ``
the DT
routes (
itself ``
, DT
which (
would ``
leave RBS
it ``
with DT
less (
cash ``
for DT
its (
reorganization ``
. DT

It (
also ``
would DT
leave (
Eastern ``
a DT
bigger (
carrier ``
than DT
the (
scaled-down ``
one DT
proposed (
under ``
the DT
initial (
plan ``
. DT

Those (
changes ``
in DT
its (
condition ``
meant DT
the (
reorganization ``
plan DT
previously (
presented ``
to RBS
creditors ``
would RBS
have ``
to DT
be (
revamped ``
. DT

Since (
then ``
, DT
Eastern (
has ``
been DT
negotiating (
with ``
creditors DT
over (
revisions ``
, DT
but (
the ``
creditors DT
committee (
has ``
been DT
having (
problems ``
with DT
the (
revisions ``
. DT

The (
committee ``
has DT
two (
groups ``
of DT
experts (
it ``
calls RBS
on ``
to DT
analyze (
Eastern ``
's RBS
plans ``
. DT

Both (
said ``
the DT
new (
plan ``
would DT
n't (
work ``
. DT

Ernst (
& ``
Young DT
said (
Eastern ``
's DT
plans (
will ``
miss DT
its (
projections ``
of DT
earnings (
before ``
interest DT
, (
tax ``
and DT
depreciation (
by ``
$ DT
100 (
million ``
, DT
and (
that ``
Eastern DT
's (
plan ``
presented DT
no (
comfort ``
level DT
, (
according ``
to DT
a (
source ``
present DT
at (
yesterday ``
's RBS
session ``
. DT

Experts (
from ``
Goldman DT
Sachs (
estimated ``
Eastern DT
would (
miss ``
the DT
same (
mark ``
by DT
$ (
120 ``
million DT
to (
$ ``
135 DT
million (
, ``
the DT
source (
said ``
. DT

The (
experts ``
said DT
they (
expected ``
Eastern RBS
would ``
have DT
to (
issue ``
new DT
debt (
to ``
cover DT
its (
costs ``
, DT
and (
that ``
it DT
would (
generate ``
far DT
less (
cash ``
than RBS
anticipated ``
. DT

Other (
costs ``
also DT
would (
increase ``
, DT
including (
maintenance ``
, DT
because (
Eastern ``
has RBS
an ``
older RBS
fleet ``
. DT

At (
the ``
news DT
conference (
, ``
Mr. DT
Lorenzo (
and ``
Eastern DT
President (
Phil ``
Bakes DT
presented (
a ``
far DT
rosier (
assessment ``
. DT

Flanked (
by ``
flight DT
attendants (
, ``
pilots DT
and (
gate ``
agents DT
dressed (
in ``
spiffy DT
new (
blue ``
uniforms DT
, (
they ``
said DT
Eastern (
has ``
exceeded DT
its (
operational ``
goals DT
and (
is ``
filling DT
its (
seats ``
. DT

Starting (
next ``
month DT
, (
Eastern ``
will DT
begin (
flying ``
775 DT
flights (
daily ``
instead DT
of (
the ``
previously DT
announced (
700 ``
, DT
they (
said ``
. DT

Mr. (
Bakes ``
declined DT
to (
give ``
out DT
Eastern (
's ``
daily DT
losses (
, ``
but DT
said (
he ``
did DT
n't (
expect ``
Eastern DT
would (
have ``
to DT
dip (
into ``
the DT
cash (
from ``
asset DT
sales (
currently ``
held DT
in (
escrow ``
. DT

These (
accounts ``
hold RBS
several ``
hundred DT
million (
dollars ``
, DT
primarily (
from ``
asset RBS
sales ``
. DT

The (
plan ``
Eastern RBS
hopes ``
to DT
pursue (
, ``
he DT
said (
, ``
calls DT
for (
Eastern ``
to DT
have (
$ ``
390 RBS
million ``
in DT
cash (
by ``
year DT
's (
end ``
. DT

Both (
he ``
and DT
Mr. (
Lorenzo ``
predicted DT
that (
plan ``
might DT
be (
confirmed ``
in RBS
January ``
. DT

As (
to ``
negotiations DT
with (
creditors ``
, DT
Mr. (
Lorenzo ``
said DT
in (
remarks ``
after DT
the (
conference ``
`` DT
we (
'll ``
have DT
to (
see ``
how DT
they (
-LCB- ``
talks RBS
-RCB- ``
come DT
along (
. ``
'' DT

However (
, ``
he RBS
added ``
, DT
`` (
it ``
's RBS
not ``
a DT
requirement (
that ``
the DT
plan (
be ``
accepted DT
by (
creditors ``
. DT

It (
must ``
be DT
accepted (
by ``
the DT
court (
. ``
'' DT

Under (
bankruptcy ``
law DT
, (
Eastern ``
has RBS
exclusive ``
rights RBS
for ``
a DT
certain (
period ``
to DT
develop (
its ``
own DT
reorganization (
plan ``
. DT

That (
deadline ``
has DT
been (
extended ``
once DT
and (
could ``
be DT
extended (
again ``
. DT

If (
Eastern ``
can DT
get (
creditor ``
support DT
, (
court ``
confirmation RBS
of ``
its DT
plan (
could ``
be DT
relatively (
swift ``
. DT

But (
creditors ``
are RBS
free ``
to DT
press (
for ``
court DT
approval (
of ``
their DT
own (
plan ``
, DT
or (
the ``
court DT
could (
ignore ``
both DT
sides (
and ``
draw DT
its (
own ``
. DT

In (
any ``
event DT
, (
some ``
people DT
familiar (
with ``
the DT
case (
question ``
whether DT
the (
court ``
will DT
act (
by ``
January DT
as (
forecast ``
by DT
Mr. (
Lorenzo ``
and DT
Mr. (
Bakes ``
. DT

Eastern (
sought ``
bankruptcy-law DT
protection (
a ``
few DT
days (
after ``
a DT
crippling (
strike ``
began DT
March (
4 ``
. DT

Mr. (
Lorenzo ``
told RBS
reporters ``
the DT
reorganization (
Eastern ``
is DT
pursuing (
would ``
create DT
a (
carrier ``
85 DT
% (
to ``
90 DT
% (
of ``
the DT
size (
of ``
the DT
pre-bankruptcy (
Eastern ``
. DT

He (
projected ``
it DT
would (
be ``
operating DT
about (
1,000 ``
flights DT
a (
day ``
by DT
late (
spring ``
, DT
only (
slightly ``
fewer RBS
than ``
the DT
carrier (
's ``
old DT
volume (
of ``
1,050 DT
a (
day ``
. DT

HOPES (
OF ``
SIMPLIFYING DT
the (
corporate ``
minimum DT
tax (
before ``
1990 DT
are (
weakening ``
. DT

The (
method ``
of RBS
calculating ``
the DT
20 (
% ``
tax DT
, (
paid ``
if DT
it (
exceeds ``
tax RBS
figured ``
the DT
regular (
way ``
, DT
is (
due ``
for DT
a (
change ``
in DT
1990 (
, ``
thanks DT
to (
1986 ``
's DT
tax (
act ``
. DT

But (
most ``
experts RBS
agree ``
that DT
the (
concept ``
that DT
is (
to ``
be DT
introduced (
drags ``
in DT
great (
complexity ``
; DT
they (
have ``
been RBS
trying ``
to DT
head (
it ``
off DT
this (
year ``
. DT

Ways (
and ``
Means RBS
Chairman ``
Rostenkowski RBS
backed ``
a DT
simplification (
plan ``
in DT
the (
pending ``
House DT
tax (
bill ``
, DT
but (
the ``
plan DT
turns (
out ``
to DT
be (
a ``
big DT
revenue (
loser ``
. DT

Now (
the ``
Senate DT
's (
stripped-down ``
bill RBS
omits ``
any RBS
proposal ``
to DT
deal (
with ``
the DT
corporate (
tax ``
. DT

Proponents (
of ``
simplification DT
fear (
that ``

This (

fled (

In (

been (
forced ``

close (

set (
up ``

use DT
radar (

to DT
curb (

and DT
reckless (
riding ``
. DT

They (
have ``
even DT
sent (
helicopters ``
in DT
pursuit (
of ``
bikers DT
after (

equestrians (
complained ``
they DT
were (
being ``
driven DT
from (

`` (
We ``
were DT
being (

, DT
'' (
says ``
Steve DT
Fiala (
, ``
trails DT
coordinator (
of ``
the DT
East (
Bay ``
Regional DT
Park (
District ``
. DT

Two (
years ``
ago DT
, (
the ``
district DT
decided (
to ``
limit DT
the (
bikes ``
to DT
fire (
roads ``
in DT
its (
65,000 ``
hilly RBS
acres ``
. DT

From (
about ``
200,000 RBS
six ``
years DT
ago (
, ``
the DT
number (
of ``
mountain DT
bikes (
in ``
the DT
U.S. (
is ``
expected DT
to (
grow ``
to DT
10 (
million ``
in RBS
1990 ``
. DT

At (
least ``
half DT
that (
growth ``
will DT
have (
come ``
in DT
the (
past ``
three DT
years (
alone ``
. DT

The (
controversy ``
kicked DT
up (
by ``
the DT
proliferation (
of ``
these DT
all-terrain (
bicycles ``
is DT
one (
of ``
the DT
most (
divisive ``
storms RBS
to ``
blow DT
through (
the ``
national DT
conservation (
movement ``
in DT
recent (
memory ``
. DT

Bikers (
-- ``
many DT
of (
them ``
ardent RBS
environmentalists ``
-- DT
proclaim (
their ``
sport DT
an (
efficient ``
, DT
safe (
, ``
fitness-promoting DT
way (
to ``
get DT
back (
to ``
nature DT
, (
while ``
asserting DT
a (
right ``
, DT
as (
taxpayers ``
, DT
to (
pedal ``
on DT
public (
lands ``
. DT

But (
the ``
bikes DT
' (
burgeoning ``
numbers DT
, (
safety ``
concerns DT
and (
fear ``
that DT
they (
damage ``
fragile DT
landscapes (
have ``
prompted DT
pleas (
, ``
from DT
the (
Sierras ``
to DT
the (
Eastern ``
Seaboard DT
, (
to ``
ban DT
them (
from ``
the DT
back (
country ``
. DT

Key (
to ``
the DT
issue (
is ``
that DT
the (
bikes ``
, DT
in (
skillful ``
hands DT
, (
can ``
go DT
virtually (
anywhere ``
, DT
and (
in ``
reckless RBS
hands ``
can DT
become (
vehicles ``
of RBS
terror ``
. DT

An (
adept ``
bicyclist DT
can (
leap ``
from DT
a (
dead ``
stop RBS
to ``
the DT
top (
of ``
a DT
picnic (
table ``
without DT
losing (
balance ``
. DT

Such (
skills ``
allow RBS
riders ``
to DT
fly (
down ``
treacherous DT
mountain (
grades ``
at DT
speeds (
of ``
up DT
to (
40 ``
miles DT
an (
hour ``
-- DT
a (
thrill ``
for DT
the (
cyclist ``
but DT
a (
nightmare ``
for DT
unsuspecting (
hikers ``
or RBS
equestrians ``
. DT

For (
harried ``
public-land DT
managers (
across ``
the DT
nation (
, ``
the DT
response (
is ``
increasingly DT
to (
shut ``
the RBS
gates ``
. DT

The (
state ``
of DT
California (
, ``
following DT
the (
lead ``
of DT
some (
regional ``
parks RBS
, ``
recently DT
adopted (
regulations ``
that DT
closed (
nearly ``
all DT
hiking (
paths ``
in DT
state (
parks ``
to DT
mountain (
bicycles ``
. DT

The (
move ``
largely DT
consigns (
them ``
to DT
roads (
used ``
by DT
motorized (
vehicles ``
. DT

Most (
other ``
states DT
have (
enacted ``
similar RBS
bans ``
. DT

The (
bikes ``
are RBS
unwelcome ``
on RBS
trails ``
in DT
national (
parks ``
. DT

Even (
the ``
U.S. DT
Forest (
Service ``
, DT
whose (
lenient ``
`` DT
multiple-use (
'' ``
philosophy DT
permits (
motorized ``
vehicles DT
on (
thousands ``
of DT
miles (
of ``
its DT
trails (
across ``
the DT
U.S. (
, ``
has DT
begun (
to ``
close DT
some (
lands ``
to DT
the (
bikes ``
, DT
including (
major ``
portions RBS
of ``
the DT
popular (
Pacific ``
Crest DT
Trail (
, ``
which DT
stretches (
from ``
California DT
to (
Canada ``
. DT

Often (
these ``
closings DT
come (
after ``
vigorous DT
anti-bike (
lobbying ``
by DT
conservation (
organizations ``
, DT
the (
politically ``
potent RBS
Sierra ``
Club DT
among (
them ``
. DT

Sierra (
has ``
been RBS
instrumental ``
in RBS
securing ``
a DT
number (
of ``
the DT
California (
bans ``
. DT

It (
has ``
been RBS
waging ``
an DT
all-out (
campaign ``
to DT
beat (
back ``
a DT
proposal (
, ``
pushed DT
by (
Utah ``
bike DT
groups (
, ``
to DT
allow (
the ``
cycles DT
in (
federally ``
designated DT
wilderness (
areas ``
, DT
where (
they ``
are DT
now (
prohibited ``
. DT

Yet (
Sierra ``
's DT
hard-line (
stance ``
has DT
created (
something ``
of DT
a (
rift ``
in DT
the (
organization ``
, DT
which (
estimates ``
that DT
17 (
% ``
of DT
its (
500,000 ``
members RBS
own ``
mountain RBS
bikes ``
. DT

Pressure (
from ``
these DT
members (
prompted ``
the DT
club (
recently ``
to DT
soften (
its ``
anti-bike DT
rhetoric (
; ``
it DT
no (
longer ``
, DT
for (
example ``
, DT
lumps (
the ``
bikes DT
into (
the ``
same DT
category (
as ``
motorcycles DT
and (
other ``
terrain-marring DT
off-road (
vehicles ``
. DT

But (
the ``
club DT
still (
insists ``
that DT
public (
lands ``
ought RBS
to ``
be DT
closed (
to ``
the DT
bikes (
unless ``
studies DT
indicate (
the ``
bikes DT
wo (
n't ``
injure DT

`` (
I ``

we (

making DT
progress (

Few (
would ``
have DT
foreseen (
such ``
a DT
furor (
when ``
, DT
a (
decade ``
ago RBS
, ``
some DT
Marin (
County ``
bicycle DT
enthusiasts (
created ``
a DT
hybrid (
bike ``
using DT
fat (
tires ``
, DT
lightweight (
metallurgy ``
and DT
multi-gear (
technology ``
. DT

They (
wanted ``
a DT
machine (
that ``
would DT
allow (
them ``
to DT
pedal (
into ``
rugged DT
terrain (
then ``
inaccessible DT
to (
cycles ``
. DT

They (
got ``
a DT
machine (
more ``
responsive DT
, (
more ``
stable DT
and (
in ``
many DT
ways (
easier ``
to DT
ride (
than ``
the DT
thin-tired (
racing ``
bikes DT
that (
then ``
were DT
the (
rage ``
. DT

When (
the ``
bikes DT
first (
entered ``
mass RBS
production ``
in DT
1981 (
, ``
they DT
were (
dismissed ``
as DT
a (
fad ``
. DT

Last (
year ``
, DT
25 (
% ``
of DT
the (
10 ``
million DT
bicycles (
sold ``
in DT
the (
U.S. ``
were DT
mountain (
bikes ``
. DT

In (
California ``
, DT
a (
bellwether ``
market RBS
, ``
they DT
accounted (
for ``
more DT
than (
80 ``
% RBS
of ``
all DT
bike (
sales ``
. DT

The (
majority ``
of DT
the (
bikes ``
never RBS
even ``
make DT
it (
into ``
the DT
high (
country ``
. DT

City (
dwellers ``
love DT
them (
because ``
they DT
shift (
smoothly ``
in DT
traffic (
, ``
bounce DT
easily (
over ``
curbs DT
and (
roll ``
through DT
road (
glass ``
with DT
far (
fewer ``
flat RBS

than DT
racing (
bikes ``
. DT

Butte ``

everyone DT
here (

the ``

once (

the ``

a DT
small (

Fed (
officials ``
appear RBS
reluctant ``

further (
because ``

n't (
appear ``

, (
several ``

The (

has RBS
allowed ``

a DT
huge (

A (
`` ``

the (

Its (

sold (

In (

the (

captured RBS
405 ``

, ``
the DT
largest (
victory ``
in DT
the (
history ``
of DT

democracy ``

The (
landslide ``
was DT
fueled (
by ``
panic DT
that (
prevailed ``
in DT
India (
at ``
the RBS
time ``

Mrs. (

had DT
been (
assassinated ``
by DT
separatist (
Sikhs ``

and (
many ``

feared ``

three (

the (

In (

Mrs. (

19-month (

the DT
opposition (
will ``
struggle RBS
this ``

be DT
clear (

it (

The (
arms-kickback ``
scandal DT
is (
likely ``
to DT
be (
one ``
of DT
the (
big ``
talking DT
points (
in ``
the DT
campaign (
, ``
but DT
it (
's ``
unclear DT
how (
it ``
is DT
viewed (
by ``
average DT
Indian (
voters ``
. DT

In (
1986 ``
, DT
India (
signed ``
a DT
$ (
1.4 ``
billion RBS
contract ``
with DT
AB (
Bofors ``
, DT
a (
unit ``
of DT
Nobel (
Industries ``
Sweden DT
AB (
, ``
to DT
purchase (
400 ``
artillery RBS
pieces ``
. DT

The (
contract ``
was DT
negotiated (
by ``
the DT
countries (
' ``
two RBS
prime ``
ministers RBS
, ``
and DT
was (
supposed ``
to DT
be (
free ``
of DT
commissions (
or ``
agents DT
' (
costs ``
. DT

In (
April ``
1987 DT
, (
evidence ``
surfaced DT
that (
commissions ``
were RBS
paid ``
. DT

The (
opposition ``
charged DT
that (
the ``
money DT
was (
used ``
to DT
bribe (
Indian ``
government DT
officials (
, ``
an DT
allegation (
denied ``
by DT
Mr. (
Gandhi ``
's RBS
administration ``
. DT

But (
many ``
of DT
his (
statements ``
on DT
the (
issue ``
in DT
Parliament (
subsequently ``
were DT
proven (
wrong ``
by DT
documentary (
evidence ``
. DT

The (
scandal ``
has DT
faded (
and ``
flared DT
, (
but ``
recent DT
disclosures (
propelled ``
it DT
back (
onto ``
the DT
front (
pages ``
, DT
and (
that ``
has DT
helped (
galvanize ``
the DT
opposition (
, ``
which DT
last (
week ``
blocked RBS
passage ``
of DT
two (
constitutional ``
amendment RBS
bills ``
. DT

It (
was ``
the DT
first (
time ``
in DT
20 (
years ``
that DT
such (
government ``
bills DT
were (
defeated ``
. DT

In (
a ``
country RBS
where ``
a DT
bribe (
is ``
needed DT
to (
get ``
a DT
phone (
, ``
a DT
job (
, ``
and DT
even (
into ``
a DT
school (
, ``
the DT
name (
Bofors ``
has DT
become (
a ``
potent DT
rallying (
cry ``
against DT
the (
government ``
. DT

That (
illustrates ``
the DT
kind (
of ``
disappointment DT
many (
Indians ``
feel DT
toward (
Mr. ``
Gandhi DT
, (
whom ``
they DT
zestfully (
elected ``
and DT
enthusiastically (
supported ``
in DT
his (
first ``
two RBS
years ``
in RBS
power ``
. DT

His (
term ``
has DT
produced (
no ``
spectacular RBS
failures ``
in DT
politics (
, ``
in DT
the (
economy ``
or DT
on (
the ``
military DT
front (
, ``
and DT
has (
chalked ``
up DT
some (
successes ``
. DT

But (
the ``
average DT
Indian (
had ``
tremendous DT
hope (
in ``
the DT
youthful (
leader ``
and DT
his (
promise ``
to DT
make (
both ``
government RBS
and ``
the DT
ruling (
party ``
more RBS
effective ``
and DT
less (
corrupt ``
. DT

His (
failures ``
in DT
those (
two ``
areas DT
deeply (
, ``
and DT
sometimes (
bitterly ``
, RBS
disappointed ``
many RBS
Indians ``
. DT

the (

The (

provision DT
, (
affecting ``
so-called DT
235 (

has (
met ``
strong RBS
opposition ``
from DT
investment (
bankers ``
represented DT
by (
the ``
Public DT
Securities (
Association ``

And (
a ``
squad DT
of (
influential ``
former DT
Senate (
aides ``
employed DT
by (
the ``
Wall DT
Street (
firm ``
Salomon DT
Brothers (
came ``
to DT
the (
Capitol ``

a (
vain ``
attempt DT
to (
strip ``
the RBS
provision ``
. DT

By (
an ``
11-2 DT
margin (
, ``
Senate DT
negotiators (
voted ``
to DT
preserve (
the ``
235 DT
mortgage (
refinancing ``
plan DT
, (
and ``
despite DT
powerful (
allies ``
, DT
the (
opposition ``
found DT
itself (
undercut ``
by DT
an (
unusual ``
alliance DT
of (
liberals ``
and RBS
conservatives ``
. DT

The (
government ``
currently DT
is (
subsidizing ``
an DT
estimated (
23,000 ``
loans DT
above (
11 ``
% DT
under (
the ``
235 DT
program (
, ``
and DT
however (
disruptive ``
to DT
private (
investors ``
, DT
the (
refinancing ``
is DT
expected (
to ``
yield RBS
at ``
least DT
$ (
15 ``
million DT
in (
savings ``
in DT
fiscal (
1990 ``
. DT

This (
sum ``
has DT
been (
guarded ``
jealously DT
by (
appropriators ``
anxious DT
to (
offset ``
spending DT
elsewhere (
, ``
and DT
conservative (
Sen. ``
Phil DT
Gramm (
cast ``
the DT
fight (
as ``
a DT
populist (
stand ``
against DT
monied (
interests ``
. DT

`` (
We ``
are DT
stewards (
here ``
, DT
not (
of ``
the DT
mortgage (
companies ``
, DT
but (
the ``
taxpayers RBS
, ``
'' DT
said (
the ``
Texas RBS
Republican ``
. DT

The (
action ``
came DT
as (
the ``
administration DT
won (
final ``
congressional DT
approval (
of ``
$ DT
9 (
million ``
in DT
assistance (
for ``
elections DT
scheduled (
in ``
Nicaragua DT
in (
February ``
. DT

The (
bulk ``
of DT
the (
money ``
would RBS
be ``
funneled RBS
through ``
the DT
National (
Endowment ``
for DT
Democracy (
, ``
but DT
the (
legislation ``
is DT
so (
vaguely ``
written DT
that (
it ``
has DT
been (
dogged ``
by DT
questions (
regarding ``
the DT
money (
's ``
true DT
purpose (
and ``
its DT
ultimate (
destination ``
. DT

The (
Senate ``
had RBS
refused ``
late RBS
Friday ``
to DT
invoke (
cloture ``
and DT
limit (
debate ``
, DT
but (
behind ``
the DT
bipartisan (
leadership ``
, DT
a (
solid ``
majority DT
took (
shape ``
yesterday DT
and (
brushed ``
aside DT
amendments (
seeking ``
to DT
cut (
the ``
total DT
package (
or ``
steer DT
it (
away ``
from DT
direct (
aid ``
to DT
political (
parties ``
. DT

Final (
approval ``
-- DT
on (
a ``
64-35 DT
roll (
call ``
-- DT
was (
never ``
in DT
doubt (
, ``
but DT
the (
opposition ``
drew DT
an (
unusual ``
mix DT
of (
senators ``
, DT
including (
Republicans ``
Jesse DT
Helms (
and ``
Warren DT
Rudman (
and ``
Democrats DT
Bill (
Bradley ``
and DT
John (
Glenn ``
. DT

The (
money ``
will DT
be (
applied ``
for DT
voter (
registration ``
and DT
election (
monitoring ``
, DT
but (
more ``
than DT
half (
is ``
likely DT
to (
go ``
to DT
the (
Union ``
Nacional DT
Opositora (
party ``
. DT

Critics (
warned ``
such DT
cash (
contributions ``
may DT
only (
undercut ``
the DT
opposition (
party ``
's DT
standing (
, ``
and DT
one (
irony ``
is DT
that (
under ``
Nicaraguan DT
law (
a ``
major DT
portion (
of ``
the DT
opposition (
party ``
's DT
funds (
must ``
be DT
shared (
with ``
the DT
government (
's ``
Supreme DT
Electoral (
Council ``
. DT

Within (
the ``
appropriations DT
conference (
yesterday ``
, DT
the (
$ ``
67 DT
billion (
measure ``
is DT
the (
second ``
largest DT
of (
the ``
annual DT
domestic (
spending ``
bills DT
and (
covers ``
a DT
disparate (
collection ``
of DT
accounts (
for ``
science DT
, (
housing ``
, DT
veterans (
and ``
the RBS
environment ``
. DT

The (
decision ``
to DT
raise (
the ``
ceiling DT
on (
FHA ``
home DT
loans (
still ``
faces DT
strong (
opposition ``
in DT
the (
House ``
. DT

But (
it ``
is DT
driven (
by ``
the DT
same (
fiscal ``
pressures RBS
that ``
have DT
forced (
lawmakers ``
to DT
resort (
to ``
various DT
bookkeeping (
devices ``
to DT
juggle (
as ``
much DT
as (
$ ``
1 DT
billion (
in ``
spending DT
that (
would ``
otherwise DT
put (
the ``
bill DT
over (
budget ``
. DT

These (
costs ``
will DT
complicate (
the ``
budget DT
picture (
in ``
fiscal DT
1991 (
, ``
and DT
the (
measure ``
further DT
commits (
Congress ``
to DT
a (
set ``
of DT
costly (
projects ``
, RBS
including ``
the DT
first (
construction ``
funds RBS
for ``
the DT
space (
station ``
. DT

The (
station ``
is DT
promised (
$ ``
1.8 DT
billion (
within ``
the DT
$ (
5.36 ``
billion RBS
provided ``
for DT
research (
and ``
development DT
in (
the ``
National DT
Aeronautics (
and ``
Space DT
Administration (
, ``
and DT
the (
nation ``
's DT
high-speed (
aerospace ``
plane DT
-- (
cut ``
by DT
the (
Senate ``
-- DT
could (
receive ``
as DT
much (
as ``
$ DT
60 (
million ``
in DT
new (
funds ``
or RBS
transfers ``
. DT

Similarly (
, ``
the DT
House (
agreed ``
to DT
add (
back ``
$ DT
62 (
million ``
to DT
continue (
work ``
on DT
the (
advanced ``
communications DT
technology (
satellite ``
, DT
being (
developed ``
by RBS
General ``
Electric RBS
Co ``
. DT

And (
while ``
setting DT
a (
statutory ``
limit DT
of (
$ ``
1.6 DT
billion (
on ``
the DT
automated (
space ``
probe DT
, (
the ``
conference DT
appropriated (
$ ``
30 DT
million (
for ``
the DT
start-up (
of ``
the DT
CRAF-Cassini (
mission ``
, DT
a (
successor ``
to DT
the (
Voyager ``
space RBS
probe ``
. DT

Among (
major ``
domestic DT
agencies (
, ``
the DT
Environmental (
Protection ``
Agency RBS
stands ``
to DT
receive (
increases ``
significantly RBS
beyond ``
those DT
sought (
by ``
the DT
administration (
, ``
with DT
pollution (
abatement ``
and DT
control (
accounts ``
growing DT
by (
14 ``
% DT
to (
about ``
$ DT
829.9 (
million ``
. DT

An (
estimated ``
$ DT
1.57 (
billion ``
is DT
separately (
allocated ``
for DT
the (
National ``
Science RBS
Foundation ``
, DT
and (
within ``
the DT
Housing (
and ``
Urban DT
Development (
Department ``
, DT
more (
than ``
$ DT
9.2 (
billion ``
is DT
provided (
for ``
federally DT
assisted (
housing ``
, DT
including (
an ``
expanded DT
effort (
to ``
modernize DT
public (
housing ``
units DT
that (
serve ``
the DT
poorest (
families ``
. DT

To (
an ``
unusual DT
degree (
, ``
the DT
massive (
bill ``
has DT
become (
a ``
vehicle DT
for (
lawmakers ``
to DT
earmark (
funds ``
for RBS
projects ``
in DT
home (
states ``
. DT

While (
the ``
practice DT
was (
discouraged ``
in DT
the (
past ``
, DT
the (
conference ``
agreement DT
is (
laced ``
with RBS
veterans ``
' DT
hospitals (
, ``
environmental DT
projects (
and ``
urban DT
grants (
designated ``
for DT
specific (
communities ``
. DT

The (
most ``
striking DT
example (
yesterday ``
may DT
have (
been ``
in DT
community (
development ``
funds DT
, (
where ``
the DT
two (
houses ``
had DT
separately (
approved ``
a DT
total (
of ``
27 DT
projects (
valued ``
at DT
$ (
20 ``
million DT
, (
and ``
the DT
conference (
added ``
15 DT
more (
valued ``
at DT
$ (
8 ``
million DT
to (
ostensibly ``
preserve DT
`` (
balance ``
'' DT
between (
the ``
House DT
and (
Senate ``
. DT

Yesterday (
's ``
conference DT
agreement (
is ``
the DT
second (
major ``
bill DT
to (
emerge ``
from DT
negotiations (
this ``
week DT
, (
as ``
appropriators DT
approved (
a ``
fiscal DT
1990 (
transportation ``
bill DT
late (
Monday ``
that DT
includes (
a ``
sweeping DT
ban (
on ``
smoking DT
on (
most ``
domestic DT
airline (
flights ``
. DT

An (
exemption ``
will DT
remain (
for ``
flights DT
longer (
than ``
six DT
hours (
to ``
Hawaii DT
and (
Alaska ``
, DT
but (
estimates ``
by DT
the (
tobacco ``
industry DT
yesterday (
indicate ``
all RBS
but ``
about DT
30 (
flights ``
would DT
be (
covered ``
. DT

Separately (
, ``
a DT
third (
conference ``
report RBS
covering ``
an DT
$ (
18.4 ``
billion DT
Treasury (
and ``
Postal DT
Service (
bill ``
was DT
sent (
to ``
the DT
Senate (
after ``
passing DT
the (
House ``
on DT
a (
383-30 ``
roll DT
call (
yesterday ``
. DT

And (
after ``
weeks DT
of (
delay ``
, DT
the (
appropriations ``
process DT
is (
beginning ``
to DT
take (
some ``
final RBS
shape ``
. DT

Defense (
and ``
foreign DT
aid (
are ``
the DT
two (
most ``
critical DT
areas (
remaining ``
from DT
the (
administration ``
's RBS
standpoint ``
. DT

And (
among ``
domestic DT
programs (
, ``
the DT
most (
serious ``
threat DT
is (
White ``
House DT
opposition (
to ``
abortion DT
riders (
attached ``
to DT
separate (
bills ``
funding DT
the (
District ``
of DT
Columbia (
and ``
Department DT
of (
Health ``
and DT
Human (
Services ``
. DT

The (
same ``
issue DT
threatens (
to ``
spill DT
over (
to ``
the DT
foreign (
aid ``
debate DT
, (
and ``
Mr. DT
Bush (
also ``
is DT
threatening (
to ``

any (
agreement ``
that DT

Senate-passed ``
provisions DT
renewing (
U.S. ``
support DT
for (
the ``
United DT
Nations (

In (
a ``

, DT
Rep. (
David ``
Obey DT
, (
chairman ``
of DT
the (
House ``
appropriations RBS
subcommittee ``
for DT
foreign (
operations ``
, DT
warned (
Mr. ``
Bush RBS
that ``
the DT
result (
of ``
his DT
`` (
ultimatum ``
'' DT
could (
weaken ``

to (
accommodate ``

in (

`` (

When (
the ``
Soviets RBS
announced ``
their DT
last (
soldier ``
had DT
left (
Afghanistan ``
in DT
February (
, ``
the DT
voices (
of ``
skepticism DT
were (
all ``
but DT
drowned (
out ``
by DT
an (
international ``
chorus DT
of (
euphoria ``
. DT

It (
was ``
`` DT
the (
Soviets ``
' DT
Vietnam (
. ``
'' DT

The (
Kabul ``
regime DT
would (
fall ``
. DT

Millions (
of ``
refugees RBS
would ``
rush RBS
home ``
. DT

A (
resistance ``
government DT
would (
walk ``
into RBS
Kabul ``
. DT

Those (
who ``
bought DT
that (
illusion ``
are DT
now (
bewildered ``
. DT

Eight (
months ``
after DT
Gen. (
Boris ``
Gromov DT
walked (
across ``
the DT
bridge (
into ``
the DT
U.S.S.R. (
, ``
a DT
Soviet-controlled (
regime ``
remains DT
in (
Kabul ``
, DT
the (
refugees ``
sit RBS
in ``
their DT
camps (
, ``
and DT
the (
restoration ``
of DT
Afghan (
freedom ``
seems DT
as (
far ``
off DT
as (
ever ``
. DT

But (
there ``
never RBS
was ``
a DT
chance (
that ``
the DT
Afghan (
resistance ``
would RBS
overthrow ``
the DT
Kabul (
regime ``
quickly DT
and (
easily ``
. DT

Soviet (
leaders ``
said DT
they (
would ``
support DT
their (
Kabul ``
clients RBS
by ``
all DT
means (
necessary ``
-- DT
and (
did ``
. DT

The (
U.S. ``
said DT
it (
would ``
fully RBS
support ``
the DT
resistance (
-- ``
and DT
did (
n't ``
. DT

With (
the ``
February DT
1987 (
U.N. ``
accords DT
`` (
relating ``
to DT
Afghanistan (
, ``
'' DT
the (
Soviet ``
Union DT
got (
everything ``
it DT
needed (
to ``
consolidate DT
permanent (
control ``
. DT

The (
terms ``
of DT
the (
Geneva ``
accords DT
leave (
Moscow ``
free DT
to (
provide ``
its RBS
clients ``
in DT
Kabul (
with ``
assistance DT
of (
any ``
kind DT
-- (
including ``
the DT
return (
of ``
Soviet DT
ground (
forces ``
-- DT
while (
requiring ``
the DT
U.S. (
and ``
Pakistan RBS
to ``
cut DT
off (
aid ``
. DT

The (
only ``
fly DT
in (
the ``
Soviet DT
ointment (
was ``
the DT
last-minute (
addition ``
of DT
a (
unilateral ``
American RBS
caveat ``
, DT
that (
U.S. ``
aid RBS
to ``
the DT
resistance (
would ``
continue DT
as (
long ``
as DT
Soviet (
aid ``
to DT
Kabul (
did ``
. DT

But (
as ``
soon DT
as (
the ``
accords DT
were (
signed ``
, DT
American (
officials ``
sharply DT
reduced (
aid ``
. DT

In (
February ``
1989 DT
, (
when ``
the DT
Soviets (
said ``
they DT
had (
completed ``
their DT
pullout (
, ``
the DT
U.S. (
cut ``
it RBS
further ``
. DT

Not (
so ``
the RBS
Soviets ``
. DT

Gen. (
Gromov ``
himself DT
said (
Soviet ``
troops RBS
expected ``
to DT
leave (
behind ``
more RBS
than ``
$ DT
1 (
billion ``
of DT
military (
equipment ``
and DT
installations (
for ``
the DT
Kabul (
regime ``
. DT

Since (
the ``
troop RBS
withdrawal ``
, DT
Moscow (
has ``
poured DT
in (
an ``
additional DT
$ (
200 ``
to DT
$ (
300 ``
million DT
worth (
per ``
month DT
-- (
nearly ``
$ DT
2 (
billion ``
since DT
February (
, ``
equivalent DT
to (
the ``
total DT
U.S. (
aid ``
to DT
the (
resistance ``
in DT
nine (
years ``
. DT

This (
includes ``
what DT
Deputy (
Foreign ``
Minister DT
Yuli (
Vorontsov ``
fetchingly DT
called (
`` ``
new DT
peaceful (
long-range ``
weapons DT
, (
'' ``
including DT
more (
than ``
800 DT
SCUD (
missiles ``
. DT

By (
early ``
May DT
, (
Moscow ``
had RBS
delivered ``
, DT
for (
example ``
, DT
1,000 (
trucks ``
, DT
about (
100 ``
tanks DT
, (
artillery ``
and DT
hundreds (
of ``
other DT
combat (
vehicles ``
. DT

Later (
that ``
month RBS
, ``
it DT
added (
an ``
entire DT
tank (
brigade ``
, DT
including (
120 ``
T-72 RBS
tanks ``
and DT
more (
than ``
40 DT
BMP (
state-of-the-art ``
infantry DT
fighting (
vehicles ``
. DT

By (
September ``
, DT
a (
new ``
Reinforced RBS
Motorized ``
Rifle DT
Brigade (
with ``
an DT
additional (
300 ``
combat DT
vehicles (
, ``
1,000 DT
more (
trucks ``
and DT
10,000 (
Soviet-trained ``
Afghan DT
troops (
had ``
arrived DT
in (
Kandahar ``
. DT

In (
the ``
last DT
few (
weeks ``
, DT
Moscow (
has ``
added DT
FROG-7B (
missiles ``
, DT
the (
bomber ``
version DT
of (
the ``
An-12 DT
, (
MiG-23BN ``
high-altitude DT
aircraft (
, ``
MiG-29s DT
, (
which ``
can DT
outfly (
Pakistan ``
's DT
U.S.-built (
F16s ``
, DT
and (
Sukhoi ``
SU-27 RBS
fighter-bombers ``
, DT
which (
can ``
outfly DT
the (
MiG-29s ``
. DT

Moscow (
claims ``
this DT
is (
all ``
needed DT
to (
protect ``
the DT
Kabul (
regime ``
against RBS
the ``
guerrilla RBS
resistance ``
. DT

It (
is ``
well-known RBS
that ``
the DT
regular (
Afghan ``
infantry DT
is (
filled ``
with DT
reluctant (
conscripts ``
. DT

But (
this ``
is DT
not (
the ``
entire DT
Afghan (
army ``
, DT
and (
it ``
is DT
no (
longer ``
Kabul RBS
's ``
only DT
military (
force ``
. DT

Complete (
units ``
have DT
been (
trained ``
and DT
indoctrinated (
in ``
the DT
U.S.S.R. (
and ``
other DT
East (
bloc ``
nations DT
; (
30,000 ``
to RBS
40,000 ``
of DT
these (
troops ``
have RBS
returned ``
. DT

In (
addition ``
, DT
the (
regime ``
has DT
established (
well-paid ``
paramilitary DT
forces (
totaling ``
more DT
than (
100,000 ``
, DT
including (
35,000 ``
Soviet-trained DT
troops (
of ``
the DT
Interior (
Ministry ``
-LRB- DT
KHAD\/WAD (
-RRB- ``
, DT
which (
still ``
is DT
directed (
by ``
1,500 RBS
Soviet ``
KGB RBS
officers ``
. DT

Even (
if ``
not DT
all (
these ``
forces DT
are (
committed ``
to DT
the (
regime ``
, DT
they (
are ``
now RBS
dependent ``
on RBS
it ``
. DT

And (
thousands ``
of DT
Afghan (
children ``
have DT
been (
taken ``
to DT
the (
Soviet ``
Union DT
, (
where ``
they DT
are (
hostage ``
for DT
the (
behavior ``
of DT
their (
families ``
. DT

Since (
1981 ``
, DT
Indian (
military ``
advisers RBS
have ``
been RBS
assisting ``
the DT
Kabul (
regime ``
. DT

In (
preparation ``
for DT
the (
withdrawal ``
, DT
Moscow (
, ``
Kabul DT
and (
New ``
Delhi DT
signed (
two ``
agreements DT
for (
several ``
hundred DT
newly (
civilian ``
Indian DT
experts (
to ``
replace DT
some (
of ``
the DT
more (
visible ``
Soviet DT
military (
personnel ``
. DT

Cuban (
military ``
personnel DT
also (
have ``
been DT
active (
in ``
Afghanistan DT
since (
1979 ``
. DT

The (
Soviets ``
cut DT
a (
deal ``
with DT
Iran (
: ``
a DT
future (
Iranian ``
role DT
in (
Afghanistan ``
in DT
exchange (
for ``
Iranian RBS
support ``
of DT
Soviet (
policy ``
. DT

The (
deal ``
was DT
symbolized (
by ``
the DT
restoration (
of ``
the DT
Shi'ite (
Sultan ``
Ali RBS
Keshtmand ``
to DT
the (
Afghan ``
prime RBS
ministry ``
. DT

Moreover (
, ``
serious DT
questions (
have ``
been DT
raised (
about ``
the DT
claimed (
withdrawal ``
of DT
Soviet (
forces ``
. DT

Before (
his ``
assassination DT
in (
1988 ``
, DT
President (
Zia ``
of DT
Pakistan (
repeatedly ``
stated DT
that (
fresh ``
Soviet RBS
troops ``
were DT
being (
inserted ``
into DT
Afghanistan (
even ``
as DT
others (
were ``
ostentatiously RBS
withdrawn ``
. DT

Rep. (
Bill ``
McCollum DT
-LRB- (
R. ``
, DT
Fla. (
-RRB- ``
reports RBS
that ``
these DT
included (
20,000 ``
to DT
30,000 (
Soviet ``
Central DT
Asian (
KGB ``
Border RBS
Guards ``
, DT
ethnically (
indistinguishable ``
from DT
Afghans (
and ``
wearing DT
unmarked (
uniforms ``
. DT

Meanwhile (
, ``
the DT
Kabul (
regime ``
is DT
increasingly (
successful ``
at RBS
portraying ``
the DT
resistance (
as ``
bloody-minded RBS
fanatics ``
. DT

In (
this ``
they DT
are (
aided ``
by DT
years (
of ``
American DT
, (
European ``
, DT
Pakistani (
and ``
Saudi DT
support (
for ``
the DT
most (
extreme ``
factions DT
-- (
radical ``
Islamic DT
fanatics (
with ``
leaders DT
whose (
policies ``
are DT
anathema (
to ``
the DT
Afghan (
public ``
. DT

This (
heavy ``
outside RBS
support ``
for DT
the (
worst ``
has DT
undermined (
better ``
, DT
moderate (
leaders ``
. DT

In (
autumn ``
last DT
year (
, ``
for DT
example (
, ``
the DT
regime (
garrison ``
at DT
Kandahar (
was ``
prepared DT
to (
surrender ``
the DT
city (
to ``
resistance RBS
moderates ``
. DT

At (
the ``
last DT
minute (
, ``
however DT
, (
Pakistani ``
officials DT
sent (
in ``
Gulbuddin DT
Hekhmatyar (
, ``
perhaps DT
the (
most ``
hated DT
and (
feared ``
of DT
the (
extremists ``
, DT
with (
a ``
demand DT
that (
the ``
surrender DT
be (
made ``
to DT
his (
forces ``
. DT

The (
deal ``
fell RBS
through ``
, DT
and (
Kandahar ``
remains RBS
a ``
major DT
regime (
base ``
. DT

The (
resistance ``
lacks DT
not (
only ``
air DT
power (
, ``
armor DT
and (
expertise ``
but DT
often (
such ``
essentials DT
as (
maps ``
, DT
mine (
detectors ``
, DT
or (
even ``
winter RBS
gloves ``
. DT

Experienced (
resistance ``
commanders DT
wanted (
to ``
use DT
guerrilla (
action ``
and DT
siege (
tactics ``
to DT
wear (
down ``
the RBS
regime ``
. DT

Instead (
, ``
they DT
were (
pressured ``
by RBS
Pakistan ``
's DT
ISI (
, ``
the DT
channel (
for ``
their DT
support (
, ``
into DT
attacking (
Jalalabad ``
. DT

They (
took ``
more DT
than (
25 ``
% DT
casualties (
; ``
journalists DT
report (
that ``
they DT
faced (
minefields ``
without DT
mine (
detectors ``
. DT

The (
wonder ``
is DT
not (
that ``
the DT
resistance (
has ``
failed DT
to (
topple ``
the DT
Kabul (
regime ``
, RBS
but ``
that DT
it (
continues ``
to DT
exist (
and ``
fight DT
at (
all ``
. DT

Last (
summer ``
, DT
in (
response ``
to DT
congressional (
criticism ``
, DT
the (
State ``
Department RBS
and ``
the DT
CIA (
said ``
they DT
had (
resumed ``
military DT
aid (
to ``
the DT
resistance (
months ``
after DT
it (
was ``
cut DT
off (
; ``
but DT
it (
is ``
not DT
clear (
how ``
much DT
is (
being ``
sent DT
or (
when ``
it DT
will (
arrive ``
. DT

For (
months ``
the DT
resistance (
has ``
been DT
defenseless (
against ``
air RBS
attack ``
. DT

Thus (
far ``
there DT
is (
no ``
indication DT
that (
they ``
have DT
been (
re-supplied ``
with DT
Stingers (
or ``
other DT
anti-aircraft (
weapons ``
. DT

Indeed (
, ``
U.S. RBS
officials ``
have DT
indicated (
to ``
the DT
press (
that ``
the DT
continuation (
of ``
aid DT
depends (
on ``
what DT
success (
the ``
weakened DT
resistance (
achieves ``
by DT
the (
end ``
of DT
this (
year ``
. DT

Moscow (
and ``
Kabul RBS
must ``
have RBS
found ``
that DT
information (
useful ``
. DT

For (
a ``
decade DT
U.S. (
policy ``
has DT
been (
incoherent ``
, DT
based (
on ``
miscalculation DT
and (
the ``
defense DT
of (
bureaucratic ``
and DT
political (
turf ``
. DT

No (
settlement ``
negotiated RBS
by ``
others DT
can (
force ``
the DT
Afghan (
people ``
to DT
give (
up ``
their RBS
struggle ``
. DT

A (
cutoff ``
of DT
U.S. (
military ``
aid DT
would (
merely ``
abandon DT
them (
to ``
die DT
in (
vain ``
. DT

Creation (
of ``
a DT
new (
, ``
realistic DT
U.S. (
policy ``
is DT
long (
overdue ``

preferred (
successor ``
, DT
President (
Bush ``
, DT
those (
two ``
cherished RBS
national-security ``
causes DT
are (
withering ``
on DT
the (
vine ``
. DT

And (
, ``
surprisingly DT
, (
little ``
more DT
than (
a ``
whimper DT
of (
protest ``
is DT
being (
heard ``
, DT
even (
though ``
Reaganauts DT
once (
breathed ``
fire DT
supporting (
the ``
Contras DT
and (
the ``
Strategic DT
Defense (
Initiative ``
. DT

`` (
The ``
programs DT
have (
arthritis ``
, DT
'' (
says ``
Rep. DT
Henry (
Hyde ``
, DT
a (
conservative ``
Republican DT
from (
Illinois ``
. DT

Yet (
, ``
he RBS
asserts ``
, DT
`` (
you ``
look DT
around (
... ``
and DT
you (
say ``
, DT
` (
Who ``
are DT
the (
leaders ``
? DT

Who (
is ``
going DT
to (
carry ``
the RBS
water ``
? RBS
' ``
'' DT

It (
is ``
n't DT
surprising (
that ``
President DT
Bush (
has ``
n't DT
led (
a ``
crusade DT
to (
pump ``
up DT
the (
Contras ``
or RBS
SDI ``
. DT

Though (
he ``
nominally DT
supports (
both ``
programs DT
, (
Mr. ``
Bush DT
has (
n't ``
been DT
a (
passionate ``
champion DT
of (
either ``
cause DT
, (
as ``
Mr. DT
Reagan (
was ``
. DT

What (
's ``
surprising RBS
is ``
that DT
there (
is ``
n't DT
more (
of ``
a DT
conservative (
outcry ``
as DT
the (
Bush ``
administration DT
lets (
the ``
programs DT
slip (
down ``
the DT
national-priority (
list ``
. DT

A (
combination ``
of DT
factors (
-- ``
a DT
weariness (
among ``
some DT
conservatives (
, ``
a DT
decline (
in ``
the DT
perception (
of ``
a DT
Soviet (
threat ``
and DT
a (
preoccupation ``
with RBS
other ``
issues DT
-- (
seem ``
to RBS
explain ``
the DT
strange (
tranquility ``
. DT

Above (
all ``
, DT
though (
, ``
conservative RBS
Republicans ``
who DT
have (
championed ``
both DT
the (
Contras ``
and DT
SDI (
are ``
reluctant DT
to (
attack ``
a DT
Republican (
president ``
for DT
failing (
to ``
do DT
more (
-- ``
though DT
that (
reluctance ``
may DT
be (
receding ``
. DT

`` (
We ``
want DT
to (
complain ``
, DT
we (
want ``
to DT
say (
something ``
about DT
it (
, ``
and DT
we (
're ``
going DT
to (
as ``
it DT
gets (
worse ``
, DT
'' (
says ``
Rep. DT
Dan (
Burton ``
, DT
an (
Indiana ``
Republican DT
who (
has ``
been DT
a (
staunch ``
Contra RBS
backer ``
. DT

`` (
But ``
it DT
's (
like ``
kicking DT
your (
father ``
in DT
the (
pants ``
. DT

You (
hate ``
to DT
do (
it ``
because DT
he (
's ``
your DT
father (
. ``
'' DT

Mr. (
Burton ``
says RBS
conservatives ``
' RBS
unhappiness ``
with DT
Mr. (
Bush ``
's DT
cautious (
handling ``
of DT
the (
recent ``
unsuccessful DT
coup (
in ``
Panama DT
will (
make ``
them DT
more (
willing ``
to DT
speak (
out ``
. DT

Of (
course ``
, DT
neither (
President ``
Bush RBS
nor ``
the DT
Congress (
has ``
actually DT
abandoned (
the ``
Contras DT
or (
SDI ``
. DT

Mr. (
Bush ``
has DT
struck (
a ``
deal DT
with (
congressional ``
leaders DT
to (
provide ``
nonlethal DT
aid (
to ``
the DT
Contras (
until ``
Nicaragua DT
holds (
national ``
elections DT
next (
February ``
. DT

But (
the ``
administration DT
has (
dropped ``
any DT
effort (
to ``
win DT
military (
aid ``
for DT
the (
rebels ``
. DT

And (
the ``
administration DT
's (
deal ``
with DT
Congress (
gives ``
several DT
congressional (
committees ``
the DT
right (
to ``
cut RBS
off ``
even DT
humanitarian (
aid ``
next RBS
month ``
, DT
though (
the ``
committees DT
are (
likely ``
to DT
let (
aid ``
continue DT
until (
February ``
. DT

Most (
analysts ``
think DT
there (
's ``
little DT
prospect (
the ``
Contras DT
can (
be ``
a DT
significant (
fighting ``
force DT
without (
U.S. ``
arms DT
, (
and ``
after DT
the (
February ``
election DT
their (
future ``
in DT
any (
form ``
will DT
be (
murky ``
at RBS
best ``
. DT

Instead (
of ``
focusing DT
on (
the ``
Contras DT
, (
Mr. ``
Bush DT
has (
switched ``
to DT
urging (
members ``
of DT
Congress (
-- ``
most DT
recently (
in ``
a DT
White (
House ``
meeting DT
yesterday (
-- ``
to DT
approve (
financing ``
for DT
the (
election ``
campaign DT
of (
political ``
opponents DT
of (
Nicaragua ``
's DT
Sandinista (
government ``
. DT

The (
administration ``
continues DT
to (
support ``
SDI DT
, (
or ``
Star DT
Wars (
, ``
and DT
it (
recently ``
lobbied DT
to (
persuade ``
the DT
Senate (
to ``
restore DT
some (
of ``
the DT
funds (
it ``
planned DT
to (
cut ``
from DT
the (
program ``
. DT

And (
just ``
last DT
week (
, ``
Defense DT
Secretary (
Dick ``
Cheney DT
gave (
a ``
strong DT
speech (
listing ``
`` DT
compelling (
reasons ``
'' DT
to (
push ``
ahead DT
with (
SDI ``
and DT
saying (
he ``
'd DT
urge (
President ``
Bush DT
to (
veto ``
a DT
defense (
bill ``
with DT
`` (
inadequate ``
'' DT
funding (
for ``
the RBS
program ``
. DT

But (
the ``
strong RBS
pitch ``
by DT
Mr. (
Cheney ``
may DT
be (
too ``
little DT
too (
late ``
to DT
prevent (
damage ``
to RBS
SDI ``
. DT

The (
House ``
has DT
already (
voted ``
for DT
a (
deep ``
cut DT
in (
funding ``
, DT
and (
in ``
the RBS
end ``
the DT
program (
's ``
backers RBS
will ``
be DT
hard (
pressed ``
to DT
head (
off ``
some DT
reduction (
in ``
spending DT
next (
year ``
. DT

And (
while ``
the DT
defense (
secretary ``
is DT
speaking (
out ``
, DT
President (
Bush ``
himself RBS
has ``
n't DT
launched (
any ``
high-visibility RBS
campaign ``
to DT
drum (
up ``
support DT
, (
as ``
President DT
Reagan (
did ``
. DT

The (
administration ``
also DT
acknowledges (
that ``
it DT
is (
n't ``
pursuing DT
Mr. (
Reagan ``
's DT
original (
vision ``
of DT
an (
`` ``
impenetrable RBS
shield ``
'' DT
protecting (
the ``
whole DT
U.S. (
, ``
but DT
rather (
a ``
more DT
modest (
version ``
. DT

More (
ominous ``
to DT
SDI (
supporters ``
, DT
the (
Bush ``
administration DT
appears (
to ``
have DT
tacitly (
accepted ``
a DT
new (
arms-control ``
proposal DT
from (
the ``
Soviet DT
Union (
that ``
spells DT
long-term (
trouble ``
for DT
Star (
Wars ``
. DT

The (
Soviets ``
have DT
agreed (
to ``
complete DT
a (
treaty ``
cutting DT
strategic (
weapons ``
without DT
including (
restrictions ``
on DT
space-based (
defenses ``
. DT

But (
the ``
Soviets DT
also (
are ``
insisting DT
that (
they ``
will DT
reserve (
the ``
right DT
to (
withdraw ``
from DT
the (
completed ``
strategic-arms DT
treaty (
later ``
on DT
if (
the ``
U.S. DT
does (
SDI ``
testing DT
or (
deployment ``
that DT
the (
Soviets ``
think DT
violates (
the ``
existing DT
anti-ballistic-missile (
treaty ``
. DT

It (
will ``
be DT
hard (
down ``
the DT
road (
to ``
persuade DT
Congress (
to ``
approve DT
money (
for ``
SDI DT
plans (
if ``
lawmakers DT
fear (
those ``
plans DT
could (
scuttle ``
a DT
completed (
treaty ``
. DT

As (
a ``
result DT
, (
Frank ``
Gaffney RBS
, ``
a DT
former (
Reagan ``
Pentagon DT
aide (
who ``
now DT
heads (
the ``
Center DT
for (
Security ``
Policy DT
, (
charges ``
that DT
the (
administration ``
's DT
`` (
professions ``
of DT
continued (
commitment ``
to DT
development (
and ``
deployment RBS
of ``
the DT
SDI (
program ``
strain DT
credulity (
. ``
'' DT

Still (
, ``
proponents DT
may (
be ``
shying DT
away (
from ``
more DT
drumbeating (
because ``
they DT
sense (
political ``
tides DT
have (
turned ``
against DT
arming (
the ``
Nicaraguan DT
rebels (
or ``
boosting DT
spending (
on ``
SDI DT
-- (
particularly ``
when DT
the (
public ``
perceives DT
the (
Soviet ``
threat DT
is (
declining ``
under DT
Mikhail (
Gorbachev ``
. DT

In (
fact ``
, DT
because (
communism ``
seems RBS
to ``
be DT
beating (
a ``
global DT
retreat (
, ``
some DT
conservatives (
may ``
simply DT
be (
so ``
pleased DT
that (
their ``
anti-communist DT
philosophy (
is ``
prevailing DT
that (
they ``
do DT
n't (
have ``
the DT
fire (
at ``
the DT
moment (
to ``
push DT
controversial (
programs ``
. DT

`` (
The ``
short DT
of (
it ``
is DT
that (
the ``
most DT
hard-bitten (
among ``
us DT
can (
not ``
get DT
into (
too ``
sour DT
a (
mood ``

a (

Some (
activists ``
are RBS
toiling ``
to RBS
raise ``
the DT
profile (
of ``
the DT
two (
causes ``
. DT

But (
they ``
say DT
they (
ca ``
n't DT
make (
much ``
headway DT
because (
of ``
a DT
lack (
of ``
willing DT
leaders (
in ``
a DT
position (
to ``
turn DT
the (
tide ``
. DT

have (
the ``
clout DT
with (

White (

that DT
they (
enjoyed ``
with DT
President (

Above (
all ``
, DT
though (

proponents DT
say (
neither ``
the DT
Contra (

the DT

be (

We (

to (

that DT
on (
Monday ``
President DT
Bush (
accepted ``
the DT
resignation (
of ``
William RBS
Allen ``
as DT
chairman (
of ``
the DT
U.S. (
Civil ``

Commission ``

Mr. (
Allen ``
, DT
appointed (
by ``
President DT
Reagan (
, ``
grew DT
understandably (
tired ``
of DT
dealing (
with ``
the DT
guerrilla (
tactics ``
of DT
his (
enemies ``
. DT

His (
recent ``
speech DT
, (
provocatively ``
titled DT
`` (
Blacks ``
? DT
Animals (
? ``
Homosexuals DT
? (
What ``
is DT
a (
Minority ``
? DT
'' (
caused ``
an DT
uproar (
when ``
its RBS
title ``
leaked RBS
out ``
. DT

Mr. (
Allen ``
's DT
commissioners (
voted ``
to DT
call (
his ``
unread RBS
speech ``
`` RBS
thoughtless ``
, DT
disgusting (
and ``
unnecessarily DT
inflammatory (
. ``
'' DT

Commissioner (
Mary ``
Francis DT
Berry (

it DT

`` ``
another DT
sad (
episode ``

. ``
'' DT

Rep. (
Don ``
Edwards DT
, (
the ``
California DT
Democrat (
, ``
warned DT
Mr. (
Allen ``
that DT
the (

be (
`` ``
outside DT
the (

jurisdiction (

'' DT

Thomas (
Stoddard ``

head (

the DT
Lambda (
Legal ``
Defense RBS
Fund ``
, DT
called (
the ``
prospect RBS
of ``
the DT
speech (
`` ``
frankly DT
shocking (
. ``
'' DT

We (
've ``
actually RBS
read ``
the RBS
speech ``
. DT

Mr. (
Allen ``
began DT
it (
with ``
a DT
warning (
to ``
his DT
hosts (
, ``
a DT
California (
church ``
group DT
that (
opposes ``
rights DT
for (
homosexuals ``
. DT

He (
said ``
that DT
other (
participants ``
in DT
the (
conference ``
`` DT
do (
not ``
believe DT
that (
the ``
rights DT
of (
Americans ``
should DT
be (
guaranteed ``
to DT
citizens (
who ``
are DT
homosexual (
, ``
'' DT
but (
that ``
`` DT
I (
mean ``
to DT
persuade (
you ``

the (
opposite ``
view RBS

'' DT

He (
recalled ``
to DT
the (
audience ``
a DT
`` (
strange ``
, DT
infelicitous (
'' ``
analogy DT
he (
once ``
heard DT
arguing (
`` ``
now DT
that (
we ``
have DT
finally (
recognized ``
that DT
American (
blacks ``
have RBS
rights ``
, DT
we (
need ``
to DT
do (
the ``
same DT
for (
animals ``
. DT

'' (
Mr. ``
Allen DT
objected (
to ``
this DT
analogy (
because ``
it DT
seems (
to ``
`` DT
assimilate (
the ``
status DT
of (
blacks ``
to DT
that (
of ``
animals DT
-- (
as ``
a DT
mere (
project ``
of DT
charity (
, ``
of DT
humaneness (
. ``
'' DT

Rights (
on ``
such DT
a (
basis ``
, DT
whether (
for ``
blacks DT
or (
homosexuals ``
, DT
are (
`` ``
mere DT
indulgences (
, ``
'' DT
he (
said ``
, DT
subject (
to ``
being DT
taken (
back ``
. DT

He (
says ``
the DT
title (
of ``
his DT
speech (
was ``
to DT
make (
his ``
point DT
that (
Americans ``
have DT
rights (
as ``
individuals DT
, (
not ``
as DT
members (
of ``
certain DT
select (
groups ``
. DT

His (
speech ``
criticized DT
the (
`` ``
idiocy DT
of (
notions ``
of DT
protected (
groups ``
in RBS
society ``
'' DT
as (
opposed ``
to DT
individual (
equality ``
or DT
, (
as ``
he DT
put (
it ``
, DT
in (
`` ``
a DT
common (
destiny ``
as DT
Americans (
. ``
'' DT

Instead (
of ``
lobbying RBS
for ``
special RBS
treatment ``
, DT
Mr. (
Allen ``
said DT
that (
homosexuals ``
and DT
others (
should ``
try DT
to (
ensure ``
equal DT
treatment (
under ``
the DT
law (
and ``
not DT
aim (
for ``
special DT
privileges (
that ``
would DT
risk (
`` ``
invidious DT
retrenchment (
with ``
government DT
complicity (
. ``
'' DT

This (
hardly ``
sounds RBS
like ``
an DT
anti-homosexual (
screed ``
. DT

What (
's ``
really RBS
going ``
on RBS
here ``
? DT

The (
three ``
most DT
important (
things ``
to DT
understand (
about ``
Mr. DT
Allen (
is ``
that DT
he (
is ``
a DT
black (
conservative ``
intellectual DT
-- (
a ``
triple DT
threat (
to ``
the DT
liberal (
establishment ``
. DT

Mr. (
Allen ``
, DT
who (
teaches ``
government DT
at (
prestigious ``
Harvey RBS
Mudd ``
College DT
in (
California ``
and DT
will (
remain ``
a DT
member (
of ``
the DT
commission (
, ``
has DT
spent (
years ``
arguing DT
that (
civil ``
rights DT
are (
individuals ``
' RBS
rights ``
. DT

He (
last ``
made RBS
waves ``
when DT
he (
dared ``
to DT
defend (
an ``
Indian DT
girl (
who ``
had DT
been (
adopted ``
by DT
non-Indian (
parents ``
off DT
her (
reservation ``
. DT

Mr. (
Allen ``
quickly DT
ran (
up ``
against DT
the (
liberal ``
establishment DT
again (
, ``
which DT
somehow (
elevated ``
the DT
vague (
concept ``
of DT
`` (
Indian ``
rights DT
'' (
above ``
the DT
rights (
of ``
individual RBS
Indians ``
. DT

There (
is ``
a DT
huge (
divide ``
between DT
Mr. (
Allen ``
's DT
we're-all-in-this-together (
view ``
and DT
the (
divisive ``
litigation RBS
approach ``
of DT
the (
civil ``
rights RBS
groups ``
. DT

Indeed (
, ``
the DT
gap (
is ``
so DT
large (
that ``
Mr. DT
Allen (
's ``
critics DT
refuse (
to ``
engage DT
the (
debate ``
. DT

Their (
ridicule ``
of DT
him (
is ``
no RBS
substitute ``
for RBS
argument ``
. DT

Their (
effort ``
to DT
run (
him ``
out DT
of (
Washington ``
is DT
an (
embarrassment ``
to DT
the (
original ``
purpose RBS
of ``
their DT
own (
movement ``
. DT

We (
hope ``
the DT
next (
head ``
of DT
the (
Civil ``
Rights DT
Commission (
will ``
be DT
as (
brave ``
as DT
Mr. (

`` DT
I (

Why (
is ``
the DT
stock (

suddenly DT
so (
volatile ``
? DT

Yesterday (
, ``
the DT
Dow (
Jones ``
Industrial DT
Average (
did ``
a DT
now (
familiar ``
dance DT
: (
It ``
plunged DT
60.25 (
points ``
before DT
lunch (
, ``
with DT
most (
of ``
the DT
drop (
occurring ``
in DT
25 (
minutes ``

Then (
, ``
it RBS
rebounded ``
to DT

down ``
only DT
18.65 (

those ``

paled (

`` (
It ``

madness ``

that (
in ``

hour (
you ``
can DT

off ``

much (

, DT

says ``
Stanford RBS
Calderwood ``
, DT
chairman (
of ``
Trinity DT

, (
Boston ``

And (
, ``
apparently RBS
, ``
it DT
is (
here ``
to RBS

. DT

Richard (
Bernstein ``
, DT
senior (
quantitative ``
analyst RBS
at ``
Merrill DT
Lynch (

, (
says ``
, DT
`` (
My ``
gut RBS
feel ``
is DT
that (
we ``
'll DT
live (
with ``
those DT
swings (
for ``
a DT
while (

'' DT

There (
are ``
many DT
reasons (
for ``
the DT
market (

jumpiness DT
: (
new ``
trading DT
vehicles (
such ``
as DT
stock-index (
futures ``
and DT
options (
; ``
computer-driven DT
strategies (
like ``
program DT
trading (
; ``
and DT
crowd (
psychology ``
. DT

But (
most ``
are DT
linked (
by ``
a DT
single (
theme ``
: DT
liquidity (
-- ``
the DT
ability (
to ``
get RBS
in ``
and DT
out (
of ``
the DT
market (
quickly ``
. DT

Prices (
are ``
moving RBS
up ``
and DT
down (
so ``
fast DT
because (
investors ``
are DT
employing (
ways ``
to DT
turn (
over ``
shares DT
at (
ever-faster ``
rates DT
and (
increasingly ``
acting DT
in (
concert ``
. DT

`` (
Institutions ``
are DT
herding (
animals ``

says ``
Peter RBS
Anderson ``
, DT
who (
heads ``
the DT
pension-fund (
management ``
arm DT
of (
IDS ``
Financial DT
Services (

. DT

`` (
We ``
watch RBS
the ``
same RBS
indicators ``
and DT
listen (
to ``
the DT
same (
prognosticators ``
. DT

Like (
lemmings ``
, DT
we (
tend ``
to DT
move (
in ``
the DT
same (
direction ``
at RBS
same ``
time RBS
. ``
'' DT

And (
that ``
, DT
naturally (
, ``
exacerbates DT
price (
movements ``
. DT

Institutions (
-- ``
who DT
now (
account ``
for DT
most (
trading ``
-- DT
count (
on ``
being RBS
able ``
to DT
buy (
and ``
sell DT
big (
blocks ``
of DT
stock (
at ``
an RBS
eye-blink ``
. DT

But (
when ``
they DT
discover (
that ``
markets DT
are (
n't ``
always DT
as (
liquid ``
as DT
they (
supposed ``

markets (
jump ``
. DT

On (

for (

, DT
Howard (
Ward ``
, DT
a (
principal ``
at DT
Scudder (

found (
that ``
`` DT
you (

buy (
blue-chips ``

quoted (
prices ``
without RBS
paying ``
up RBS

'' DT

And (
when ``
many DT
firms (
had ``
to DT
`` (
pay ``
up DT
, (
'' ``
Monday DT
's (
sudden ``
rally DT
was (
sparked ``
. DT

Trading (
in ``
futures DT
and (
options ``
, DT
some (
people ``
believe DT
, (
can ``
add DT
to (
volatility ``
. DT

Investors (
believe ``
they DT
can (
can ``
rely DT
on (
such ``
derivative DT
securities (
to ``
get DT
in (
and ``
out DT
of (
the ``
stock DT
market (
without ``
actually DT
selling (
any ``
stocks DT
; (
that ``
is DT
, (
a ``
way DT
of (
staying ``
liquid DT
even (
when ``
they DT
own (
stocks ``
. DT

These (
and ``
other DT
modern (
trading ``
methods DT
`` (
tend ``
to DT
promote (
dramatic ``
shifts DT
in (
assets ``

'' (
says ``
George DT
Douglas (
, ``
first DT
vice (
president ``
at DT
Drexel (
Burnham ``

`` (
It ``
's DT
the (
idea ``
that DT
what (
goes ``
in DT
easy (
can ``
come DT
out (
easy ``
'' DT
-- (
so ``
that RBS
bouts ``
of DT
higher (
volatility ``
get DT
built (
into ``
the DT
stock (
market ``

One (
new ``
investment DT
style (
called ``
`` DT
asset (
allocation ``
'' DT
shifts (
portfolio ``
weightings DT
between (
stocks ``
, DT
bonds (
and ``
cash DT
when (
computer ``
models DT

one ``
is DT
more (
attractive ``

For (

, DT
First (
Quadrant ``
Corp. DT
, (
an ``
asset DT
allocator (
based ``
in DT
Morristown (
, ``
N.J. DT
, (
said ``
it DT
quickly (
boosted ``
stock DT
positions (
in ``
its DT
`` (
aggressive ``
'' DT
accounts (
to ``
75 DT
% (
from ``
55 DT
% (
to ``
take DT
advantage (
of ``

prices (
Friday ``

It (
added ``
another DT
5 (
% ``
Monday RBS
before ``
stocks RBS
rallied ``

When (
they ``
did DT
, (
the ``
firm DT
reduced (
those ``

holdings (
to ``
about DT
70 (
% ``

A (
classic ``
example DT
of (
institutions ``
' DT
hunger (
for ``
liquidity DT
is (
portfolio ``

now DT
widely (
discredited ``

Before (

an (
estimated ``
$ DT
60 (

managed (
under ``
this DT
hedging (
technique ``

The (
idea ``
was DT
to (
`` ``
insure RBS
'' ``
the DT
value (
of ``
a DT
portfolio (
by ``
selling DT

when ``

The (
National ``

Administration (
said ``
a DT
computer (

Charles (
Redmond ``
, DT
a (
NASA ``
spokesman DT
, (
said ``
the DT
agency (
discovered ``
the DT
virus (
on ``
Monday RBS
on ``
the DT
collection (
of ``
computer DT
networks (
collectively ``
called DT
Internet (
and ``
expected DT
100 (
university ``

be ``

by (
today ``

Although (
the ``
network DT
is (
n't ``
connected DT
to (
the ``
computer DT
systems (
that ``
operate DT
either (
Galileo ``
or DT
the (

part (
of ``
the DT
network (
will ``
carry RBS
analyses ``
of DT
Galileo (
data ``
once DT
the (
craft ``
gets RBS
spaceborn ``
. DT

Mr. (
Redmond ``
said DT
the (
intruder ``
had DT
n't (
yet ``
done DT
any (
harm ``
but DT
the (
agency ``
feared DT
`` (
garbage ``
data RBS
could ``
be DT
substituted (
for ``
real DT
data (
. ``
'' DT

He (
estimated ``
it DT
could (
take ``
a DT
day (
for ``
a DT
computer (
security ``
manager DT
to (
expunge ``
the DT
virus (
from ``
a DT
computer (
system ``
. DT

The (
intruder ``
, DT
among (
the ``
broadest RBS
yet ``
to DT
hit (
a ``
research DT
network (
, ``
appeared DT
to (
affect ``
only DT
Digital (
Equipment ``
Corp. DT
hardware (
that ``
uses DT
Digital (
's ``
VAX\/VMS DT
operating (
system ``
. DT

It (
is ``
unrelated RBS
to ``
the DT
much-publicized (
virus ``
that DT
last (
year ``
infected RBS
Arpanet ``
, DT
a (
much ``
larger DT
network (
used ``
by DT
researchers (
at ``
universities DT
, (
laboratories ``
and DT
government (
agencies ``
around DT
the (
world ``
. DT

In (
the ``
lingo RBS
of ``
computer DT
security (
, ``
the DT
NASA (
intruder ``
is DT
technically (
a ``
computer DT
worm (
, ``
Mr. DT
Redmond (
said ``
. DT

A (
worm ``
resides DT
in (
the ``
operating DT
system (
of ``
a DT
computer (
and ``
spreads DT
by (
boring ``
into DT
other (
computers ``
contacted DT
through (
networks ``
. DT

The (
Galileo ``
worm RBS
apparently ``
was DT
hatched (
on ``
a DT
computer (
in ``
France DT
hooked (
up ``
to DT
NASA (
's ``
Space DT
Physics (
Analysis ``
Network DT
, (
Mr. ``
Redmond RBS

NASA (
said ``
the DT
Galileo (
worm ``
had DT
n't (
affected ``
its DT
computers (
or ``
the DT
computers (
of ``
other DT
government (
agencies ``
because DT
they (
had ``
modified DT
their (
systems ``
to DT
reject (
worms ``
. DT

But (
Mr. ``
Redmond RBS
said ``
the DT
worm (
hit ``
universities DT
that (
had ``
n't DT
elected (
to ``
make DT
the (
changes ``
. DT

Michael (
Alexander ``
, DT
a (
senior ``
editor DT
at (
Computerworld ``
, DT
a (
trade ``
publication DT
, (
said ``
he DT
was (
told ``
that DT
the (
worm ``
gets RBS
into ``
a DT
computer (
center ``
by DT
looking (
for ``
obvious DT
passwords (
-- ``
such DT
as (
ones ``
that DT
are (
the ``
same DT
as (
the ``
user DT
's (
name ``
. DT

If (
it ``
finds DT
one (
and ``
gets DT
into (
the ``
system DT
, (
it ``
will DT
display (
a ``
screen DT
when (
a ``
user DT
logs (
on ``
that DT
says (
, ``
`` DT
Worms (
Against ``
Nuclear DT
Killers (
... ``
. DT

You (
talk ``
of RBS
times ``
of DT
peace (
for ``
all RBS
, ``
and DT
then (
prepare ``
for DT
war (
. ``
'' DT

In (
addition ``
, DT
Mr. (
Alexander ``
said RBS
, ``
the DT
worm (
sends ``
strange DT
messages (
to ``
other DT
machines (
at ``
the DT
center (
-- ``
such DT
as (
, ``
`` DT
George (
Orwell ``
was DT
an (
optimist ``
, DT
'' (
or ``
`` DT
Do (
n't ``
feed DT
the (
bats ``
tonight RBS

'' DT

The (
worm ``
also DT
looks (
for ``
elementary DT
passwords (
that ``
confer DT
more (
privileges ``
on DT
the (
user ``
. DT

The (
passwords ``
are DT
included (
in ``
the DT
system (
software ``
when DT
it (
is ``
installed RBS
but ``
are RBS
supposed ``
to DT
be (
replaced ``
as DT
soon (
as ``
the DT
system (
is ``
up DT
and (
running ``
. DT

If (
it ``
finds DT
one (
of ``
those DT
passwords (
, ``
Mr. DT
Alexander (
said ``
, DT
the (
worm ``
will DT
do (
such ``
things DT
as (
change ``
users DT
' (
passwords ``
to DT
a (
series ``
of DT
random (
numbers ``
, DT
preventing (
them ``
from DT
signing (
on ``
to DT
the (
network ``
. DT

NASA (
estimated ``
that DT
, (
on ``
Monday RBS
, ``
about DT
four (
computer ``
centers DT
were (
affected ``
. DT

Yesterday (
, ``
the DT
number (
grew ``
to DT
40 (
; ``
today DT
the (
number ``
is DT
expected (
to ``
grow DT
to (
100 ``
. DT

NASA (
said ``
it DT
will (
take ``
about DT
a (
week ``
before DT
it (
knows ``
exactly DT
how (
many ``
centers DT
of (
the ``
6,000 DT
connected (
to ``
Internet DT
were (
affected ``
and DT
the (
extent ``
of DT
the (
damage ``
, DT
if (
any ``
. DT

Anti-nuclear (
activists ``
have DT
protested (
the ``
launch DT
of (
the ``
Galileo DT
space (
probe ``
to DT
Jupiter (
because ``
it DT
uses (
plutonium ``
to DT
generate (
the ``
electricity DT
needed (
to ``
run DT
the (
craft ``
. DT

Activists (
fear ``
that DT
if (
the ``
shuttle DT
carrying (
Galileo ``
into DT
orbit (
should ``
explode RBS
, ``
or DT
if (
Galileo ``
itself DT
crashes (
into ``
the DT
Earth (
during ``
the DT
two (
times ``
it DT
flies (
close ``
to DT
the (
planet ``
, DT
fatal (
levels ``
of DT
plutonium (
would ``
be DT
released (
into ``
the RBS
atmosphere ``
. DT

So (
far ``
Galileo DT
has (
been ``
delayed DT
twice (
, ``
once DT
because (
of ``
a DT
computer (
malfunction ``
connected DT
with (
a ``
space-shuttle DT
engine (
, ``
and DT
yesterday (
because ``
of DT
the (
weather ``
. DT

NASA (
said ``
the DT
Galileo (
worm ``
had RBS
nothing ``
to DT
do (
with ``
either RBS
delay ``
. DT

Mr. (
Alexander ``
of DT
Computerworld (
said ``
hackers DT
have (
gone ``
after DT
SPAN (
before ``
. DT

He (
said ``
the DT
Chaos (
Computer ``
Club RBS
, ``
of DT
West (
Germany ``
, DT
once (
managed ``
to DT
invade (
SPAN ``
and DT
do (
such ``
things DT
as (
change ``
the DT
value (
of ``
pi DT
, (
messing ``
up DT
some (
calculations ``
. DT

It (
is ``
now DT
a (
commonplace ``
that DT
prosecutors (
are ``
bringing DT
criminal (
indictments ``
in DT
cases (
where ``
until DT
a (
few ``
years DT
ago (
only ``
a DT
civil (
action ``
at DT
most (
would ``
have DT
been (
brought ``
. DT

Yet (
it ``
is DT
also (
axiomatic ``
that DT
the (
power ``
to DT
create (
new ``
crimes DT
belongs (
only ``
to DT
the (
legislature ``
, DT
and (
not ``
to RBS
courts ``
. DT

Beginning (
in ``
the DT
early (
19th ``
century DT
, (
with ``
U.S. DT
v. (
Hudson ``
and DT
Goodwin (
, ``
the DT
Supreme (
Court ``
has DT
repeatedly (
held ``
that DT
a (
judicial ``
power DT
to (
declare ``
conduct RBS
to ``
be DT
against (
the ``
public DT
interest (
and ``
hence DT
criminal (
, ``
while DT
well (
established ``
in DT
British (
law ``
, DT
would (
usurp ``
legislative DT
authority (
under ``
the DT
doctrine (
of ``
separation DT
of (
powers ``
. DT

That (
's ``
the RBS
conventional ``
theory RBS
anyway ``
. DT

In (
practice ``
, DT
however (
, ``
the DT
line (
between ``
interpretation DT
and (
redefinition ``
of DT
the (
criminal ``
law DT
long (
ago ``
began DT
to (
blur ``
. DT

In (
particular ``
, DT
a (
common ``
law RBS
of ``
white-collar RBS
crime ``
has DT
developed (
with ``
surprising DT
rapidity (
over ``
the DT
past (
decade ``
. DT

For (
example ``
, DT
although (
insider ``
trading DT
has (
long ``
been DT
criminal (
, ``
it DT
has (
never ``
been DT
statutorily (
defined ``
. DT

In (
1983 ``
, DT
the (
Supreme ``
Court DT
tried (
to ``
supply DT
a (
workable ``
definition DT
in (
the ``
Dirks DT
v. (
SEC ``
decision DT
, (
which ``
found DT
that (
liability ``
depended DT
on (
whether ``
the DT
tipper (
had ``
breached DT
his (
fiduciary ``
duty DT
to (
the ``
corporation DT
in (
order ``
to DT
obtain (
`` ``
some DT
personal (
gain ``
'' DT
and (
whether ``
the DT
tippee (
knew ``
or DT
recklessly (
disregarded ``
this RBS
fact ``
. DT

Gradually (
, ``
however RBS
, ``
lower DT
courts (
and ``
prosecutors DT
have (
pushed ``
this DT
definition (
to ``
its DT
breaking (
point ``
. DT

Consider (
the ``
facts RBS
underlying ``
the DT
1989 (
conviction ``
of DT
Robert (
Chestman ``
. DT

Prior (
to ``
a DT
tender (
offer ``
by DT
A&P (
for ``
Waldbaum DT
Inc. (
in ``
1986 DT
, (
the ``
founder DT
of (
the ``
Waldbaum DT
's (
supermarket ``
chain DT
called (
an ``
elderly DT
relative (
to ``
tell DT
her (
to ``
assemble DT
her (
stock ``
certificates DT
for (
delivery ``
. DT

She (
called ``
her DT
daughter (
to ``
take DT
her (
to ``
the DT
bank (
, ``
who DT
, (
in ``
turn DT
, (
persuaded ``
her DT
husband (
, ``
a DT
Mr. (
Loeb ``
, DT
to (
run ``
this RBS
errand ``
. DT

Hearing (
of ``
this DT
information (
, ``
the DT
husband (
discussed ``
it DT
with (
his ``
broker DT
, (
Mr. ``
Chestman RBS
, ``
and DT
Mr. (
Chestman ``
then DT
bought (
for ``
his DT
own (
account ``
and DT
other (
clients ``
. DT

Basically (
, ``
Mr. DT
Chestman (
was ``
a DT
fourth-level (
tippee ``
. DT

Did (
Mr. ``
Loeb DT
, (
his ``
tipper DT
, (
breach ``
a DT
fiduciary (
duty ``
-LRB- DT
and (
, ``
if DT
so (
, ``
to DT
whom (
-RRB- ``
? DT

Did (
Mr. ``
Loeb RBS
seek ``
personal DT
gain (
-LRB- ``
and DT
if (
so ``
, DT
how (
-RRB- ``
? DT

Or (
did ``
Mr. DT
Chestman (
only ``
hear DT
a (
market ``
rumor DT
-LRB- (
which ``
one DT
may (
lawfully ``
trade DT
upon (
-RRB- ``
? DT

The (
line ``
seems DT
awfully (
thin ``
for DT
criminal-law (
purposes ``
. DT

A (
second ``
illustration DT
is (
supplied ``
by DT
the (
recent ``
guilty DT
plea (
entered ``
by DT
Robert (
Freeman ``
, DT
formerly (
head ``
of DT
arbitrage (
at ``
Goldman RBS
, ``
Sachs DT
& (
Co ``
. DT

Essentially (
, ``
Mr. RBS
Freeman ``
had DT
invested (
heavily ``
in DT
the (
Beatrice ``
leveraged DT
buy-out (
, ``
when DT
he (
was ``
told DT
by (
another ``
prominent DT
trader (
, ``
Bernard DT
`` (
Bunny ``
'' DT
Lasker (
, ``
that DT
the (
deal ``
was DT
in (
trouble ``
. DT

After (
placing ``
orders DT
to (
sell ``
, DT
Mr. (
Freeman ``
called DT
Martin (
Siegel ``
, DT
an (
investment ``
banker DT
at (
Kidder ``
, DT
Peabody (
& ``
Co. RBS
, ``
who DT
was (
advising ``
on DT
the (
deal ``
, DT
to (
confirm ``
these RBS
rumors ``
. DT

Mr. (
Siegel ``
asked DT
Mr. (
Freeman ``
who DT
his (
source ``
was DT
and (
, ``
on DT
hearing (
that ``
it DT
was (
Bunny ``
Lasker DT
, (
responded ``
: DT
`` (
Well ``
, DT
your (
bunny ``
has DT
a (
good ``
nose RBS
. ``
'' DT

The (
illegal ``
`` DT
tip (
'' ``
of DT
the (
bunny ``
's DT
good (
nose ``
was DT
then (
largely ``
a DT
confirmation (
of ``
rumors RBS
already ``
known DT
to (
many ``
in DT
the (
market ``
. DT

Had (
the ``
case RBS
gone ``
to RBS
trial ``
the DT
same (
issues ``
would DT
have (
surfaced ``
: DT

Was (
there ``
a DT
fiduciary (
breach ``
in DT
order (
to ``
obtain DT
personal (
gain ``
? DT

Did (
Mr. ``
Freeman RBS
have ``
notice DT
of (
this ``
? DT

Finally (
, ``
was RBS
the ``
information RBS
material ``
? DT

Yet (
, ``
all DT
these (
issues ``
are RBS
subsidiary ``
to DT
a (
more ``
central RBS
issue ``
: DT
Who (
is ``
and DT
who (
should ``
be DT
making (
the ``
criminal DT
law (
here ``
? DT

It (
is ``
not DT
my (
contention ``
that DT
either (
Mr. ``
Chestman DT
or (
Mr. ``
Freeman RBS
was ``
an DT
innocent (
victim ``
of DT
prosecutorial (
overzealousness ``
. DT

Arguably (
, ``
both RBS
were ``
on DT
notice (
that ``
their DT
behavior (
was ``
at DT
least (
risky ``
. DT

But (
even ``
if RBS
they ``
behaved RBS
recklessly ``
, DT
reasons (
still ``
exist DT
to (
fear ``
and DT
resist (
this ``
steady DT
process (
of ``
case-by-case DT
judicial (
extension ``
of DT
the (
law ``
of DT
insider (
trading ``
. DT

Courts (
and ``
legislatures RBS
make ``
decisions DT
in (
very ``
different DT
ways (
and ``
are DT
each (
susceptible ``
to DT
very (
different ``
kinds DT
of (
errors ``
. DT

After-the-fact (
judicial ``
examination RBS
of ``
an DT
actor (
's ``
conduct DT
has (
always ``
been DT
the (
common ``
law DT
's (
method ``
. DT

When (
only ``
civil DT
liability (
is ``
involved DT
, (
this ``
method DT
has (
the ``
undeniable DT
strengths (
of ``
factual DT
specificity (
and ``
avoidance DT
of (
overgeneralization ``
. DT

Still (
, ``
case-by-case DT
retrospective (
decision ``
making DT
of (
this ``
sort DT
is (
vulnerable ``
to DT
the (
tunnel ``
vision DT
caused (
by ``
a DT
fixation (
on ``
ad DT
hoc (
-LRB- ``
and DT
usually (
sleazy ``
-RRB- RBS
examples ``
. DT

When (
a ``
court DT
decides (
that ``
a DT
particular (
actor ``
's DT
conduct (
was ``
culpable DT
and (
so ``
extends DT
the (
definition ``
of DT
insider (
trading ``
to DT
reach (
this ``
conduct DT
, (
it ``
does DT
not (
see ``
the DT
potentially (
enormous ``
number DT
of (
other ``
cases DT
that (
will ``
be DT
covered (
by ``
the DT
expanded (
rule ``
. DT

Thus (
, ``
a DT
court (
is ``
poorly RBS
positioned ``
to DT
make (
judgments ``
about DT
the (
social ``
utility RBS
of ``
the DT
expanded (
rule ``
. DT

For (
example ``
, DT
in (
focusing ``
on DT
Mr. (
Freeman ``
's DT
attempt (
to ``
gain DT
nonpublic (
information ``
about DT
a (
deal ``
's DT
collapse (
, ``
one DT
does (
not ``
naturally DT
think (
about ``
the DT
reverse (
side ``
of DT
the (
coin ``
: DT
What (
if ``
the DT
rumor (
had ``
been RBS
false ``
? DT

Can (
a ``
security DT
analyst (
call ``
an DT
investment (
banker ``
to DT
make (
certain ``
that DT
a (
seemingly ``
improbable DT
rumor (
is ``
in DT
fact (
false ``
? DT

In (
the ``
past DT
, (
not ``
only DT
would (
reputable ``
professionals DT
have (
rushed ``
to DT
check (
out ``
such DT
rumors (
with ``
the DT
company (
, ``
but DT
companies (
listed ``
on DT
the (
major ``
stock RBS
exchanges ``
were DT
encouraged (
by ``
the DT
exchanges (
to ``
respond RBS
openly ``
to DT
such (
inquiries ``
from DT
securities (
analysts ``
. DT

Today (
, ``
after DT
Mr. (
Freeman ``
's RBS
plea ``
, DT
there (
is ``
an DT
uncertainty (
that ``
is DT
both (
unfair ``
and RBS
inefficient ``
. DT

In (
this ``
light RBS
, ``
the DT
comparative (
advantages ``
of DT
legislative (
law-making ``
become DT
clear (
: ``
-LRB- DT
1 (
-RRB- ``
Before DT
it (
acts ``
, DT
the (
legislature ``
typically RBS
will ``
hear DT
the (
views ``
of DT
representatives (
of ``
all DT
those (
affected ``
by DT
its (
decision ``
, DT
not (
just ``
the DT
immediate (
parties ``
before DT
the (
court ``
; DT
and (
-LRB- ``
2 DT
-RRB- (
the ``
legislature DT
can (
frame ``
`` DT
bright (
line ``
'' DT
standards (
that ``
create DT
less (
uncertainty ``
than DT
the (
fact-bound ``
decisions DT
of (
courts ``
. DT

Although (
legislative ``
lines DT
can (
result ``
in DT
under-inclusion (
-LRB- ``
which DT
explains (
why ``
the DT
SEC (
has ``
long DT
resisted (
a ``
legislative DT
definition (
of ``
insider DT
trading (
-RRB- ``
, DT
judicial (
lawmaking ``
inevitably DT
creates (
uncertainty ``
because DT
of (
the ``
shadowy DT
outer (
edges ``
and DT
implications (
of ``
most DT
judicial (
decisions ``
. DT

At (
least ``
when DT
the (
stakes ``
are DT
high (
, ``
uncertainty DT
in (
turn ``
results DT
in (
overinclusion ``
, DT
as (
individuals ``
do DT
not (
dare ``
to DT
approach (
an ``
uncertain DT
line (
closely ``
. DT

The (
federal ``
mail DT
and (
wire ``
fraud DT
statutes (
provide ``
even DT
better (
illustrations ``
of DT
the (
rapid ``
evolution DT
of (
a ``
federal DT
common (
law ``
of DT
white-collar (
crime ``
. DT

In (
1987 ``
, DT
the (
Supreme ``
Court RBS
attempted ``
in DT
McNally (
v. ``
U.S. DT
to (
halt ``
the DT
inexorable (
expansion ``
of DT
these (
statutes ``
by RBS
adopting ``
a DT
rule (
of ``
strict DT
construction (
for ``
ambiguous DT
criminal (
statues ``
. DT

Yet (
, ``
late DT
last (
year ``
, DT
Congress (
effectively ``
reversed DT
this (
decision ``
by DT
enacting (
a ``
one-sentence DT
statute (
that ``
defined DT
fraud (
to ``
include DT
any (
scheme ``
to DT
deprive (
another ``
of DT
`` (
the ``
intangible DT
right (
of ``
honest DT
services (
. ``
'' DT

At (
a ``
stroke RBS
, ``
this DT
may (
criminalize ``
all DT
fiduciary (
breaches ``
-LRB- RBS
and ``
possibly DT
all (
misrepresentations ``
by DT
an (
agent ``
or DT
employee (
-RRB- ``
. DT

Such (
a ``
statute RBS
illustrates ``
the DT
fundamental (
problem ``
: DT
Congress (
finds ``
it DT
is (
easier ``
to DT
pass (
sweepingly ``
moralistic DT
prohibitions (
, ``
which DT
the (
courts ``
must DT
thereafter (
interpret ``
, DT
than (
to ``
engage RBS
in ``
the DT
difficult (
line-drawing ``
distinctions DT
that (
are ``
inherently DT
its (
responsibility ``
. DT

We (
are ``
confronted DT
less (
with ``
a DT
judicial (
power ``
grab DT
than (
with ``
a DT
legislative (
giveaway ``
. DT

Predictably (
, ``
when DT
confronted (
with ``
morally DT
dubious (
behavior ``
, DT
prosecutors (
will ``
exploit DT
the (
latitude ``
such DT
openended (
statutes ``
give RBS
them ``
. DT

Over (
the ``
long RBS
run ``
, DT
however (
, ``
sleazy DT
cases (
will ``
make DT
bad (
law ``
. DT

`` (
Even ``

`` (
That ``
puts RBS
pressure ``
on DT
CD (
rates ``
. DT

Conservatives (
have ``
an DT
important (
decision ``
to RBS
make ``
this RBS
fall ``
. DT

At (
the ``
recent DT
meetings (
of ``
the DT
World (
Bank ``
and DT
International (
Monetary ``
Fund DT
, (
the ``
Bush DT
administration (
announced ``
its DT
intention (
to ``
decide DT
by (
yearend ``
the DT
size (
of ``
the DT
next (
increase ``
in DT
the (
IMF ``
's DT
capital (
base ``
. DT

While (
the ``
U.S. RBS
share ``
of DT
the (
increase ``
probably RBS
will ``
not DT
reach (
the ``
$ DT
12 (
billion ``
or DT
more (
implicit ``
in DT
the (
IMF ``
's DT
request (
for ``
a DT
doubling (
of ``
its DT
$ (
90 ``
billion DT
capital (
, ``
the DT
administration (
probably ``
will DT
agree (
to ``
a DT
multibillion-dollar (
increase ``
. DT

This (
would ``
be DT
consistent (
with ``
its DT
unwavering (
support ``
for DT
the (
Brady ``
Plan DT
and (
G-7 ``
exchange-rate RBS
intervention ``
, DT
and (
with ``
its DT
financial (
commitment ``
to DT
Mexico (
, ``
Poland DT
and (
others ``
. DT

The (
IMF ``
has DT
several (
reasons ``
for RBS
requesting ``
the RBS
increase ``
. DT

Its (
role ``
in DT
the (
economies ``
of DT
developing (
countries ``
has DT
grown (
steadily ``
since DT
the (
1970s ``
. DT

The (
size ``
and DT
pace (
of ``
disbursements DT
will (
accelerate ``
further DT
under (
the ``
Brady DT
Plan (
, ``
which DT
promises (
larger ``
and DT
earlier (
disbursements ``
to DT
approved (
countries ``
. DT

At (
least ``
three DT
other (
factors ``
have DT
encouraged (
the ``
IMF DT
to (
insist ``
on DT
increased (
capital ``
. DT

First (
, ``
it DT
argues (
that ``
its DT
capital (
base ``
must DT
be (
increased ``
in DT
order (
to ``
maintain DT
its (
size ``

While (
international ``

may ``
argue RBS
for ``
the DT
capital (

, DT
there (
is ``
a DT
clear (
economic ``
case DT
against (
it ``
. DT

Opponents (
of ``
the DT
increase (
argue ``
that DT
the (
IMF ``
practices RBS
central ``

while ``
supporting DT
ineffective (
governments ``
. DT

They (
question ``
whether DT
the (
IMF ``
has DT
any (
role ``

developing (
countries ``
, DT
given (
its ``
original DT
mandate (
to ``
assist DT
industrial (

. DT

Opponents (
show ``
that DT
there (
are ``
already DT
more (

than (
commendable ``

efforts ``

They (
worry ``
that RBS

substituting (

, DT
a (

They (

, ``
which DT
addresses (
the ``
problems DT
of (

They (
point ``

the (
numerous ``

that DT

inflated ``

themselves ``
into DT
despair (
under ``
successive DT
IMF (

Decisions (
on ``
increases RBS
in ``
the DT
IMF (
's ``
capital DT
base (
traditionally ``
are DT
made (
by ``
the DT
administration (
, ``
with DT
subsequent (
authorization ``
by RBS
Congress ``
. DT

The (
last ``
U.S. DT
congressional (
authorization ``
, DT
in (
1983 ``
, DT
was (
a ``
political RBS
donnybrook ``
and DT
carried (
a ``
$ DT
6 (
billion ``
housing DT
program (
along ``
with DT
it (
to ``
secure DT
adequate (
votes ``

The (
politics ``
of DT
the (
1990 ``
congressional DT
authorization (
are ``
likely DT
to (
be ``
similar DT
to (
those ``
of DT
previous (
authorizations ``
. DT

Liberals (
may ``
support DT
the (
stabilizing ``
, DT
quasi-governmental (
role ``
of DT
the (
IMF ``
on DT
two (
conditions ``
: DT
that (
the ``
administration DT

assurances ``

Democrats ``

that ``
the DT
legislation (
address ``

with (
dollars ``

social (
and ``
environmental RBS
concerns ``
. DT

Conservative (
Republicans ``
will DT
be (
given ``
the DT
choice (
of ``
supporting DT
or (
fighting ``
their DT
party (

popular DT
president (
in ``
an DT
election (

. DT

A (
U.S. ``
decision DT
to (
refuse ``
the DT
IMF (
its ``
capital DT
increase (
, ``
or DT
limit (
it ``
to DT
25 (
% ``
, DT
would (
bring ``
a DT
major (
change ``
in DT
international (
economic ``
policy RBS
, ``
and DT
could (
not ``
be DT
taken (
lightly ``
. DT

Commentators (
would ``
fret RBS
over ``
the DT
implications (
for ``
the DT
G-7 (
coordination ``
process RBS
and ``
the DT
stability (
of ``
world DT
financial (
markets ``
. DT

Because (
commercial ``
banks RBS
and ``
the DT
developing-country (
governments ``
believe DT
they (
will ``
get DT
a (
piece ``
of DT
any (
capital ``
increase RBS
, ``
a DT
scaled-down (
IMF ``
mission DT
would (
leave ``
both DT
feeling (
shortchanged ``
. DT

Furthermore (
, ``
a DT
U.S. (
rejection ``
of DT
the (
capital ``
increase DT
-LRB- (
and ``
transfer DT
of (
shares ``
to DT
Japan (
-RRB- ``
would DT
give (
Japan ``
an DT
argument (
against ``
future RBS
calls ``
for DT
economic (
burden-sharing ``
. DT

On (
the ``
other DT
hand (
, ``
a DT
decision (
to ``
increase DT
the (
IMF ``
's DT
capital (
would ``
reinforce RBS
the ``
central DT
economic (
role ``
of DT
multilateral (
institutions ``
in DT
developing (
countries ``
. DT

With (
the ``
increase DT
, (
even ``
more DT
developing-country (
energy ``
and DT
talent (
would ``
be DT
diverted (
from ``
creating DT
profitable (
economic ``
systems DT
to (
setting ``
up DT
economic (
planning ``
ministries DT
that (
generate ``
IMF-approved DT
economic (
plans ``
. DT

Upping (
the ``
ante RBS
could ``
slow DT
economic (
development ``
even DT
further (
, ``
as DT
countries (
delay ``
market-opening RBS
steps ``
in DT
anticipation (
of ``
richer DT
multilateral (
support ``
. DT

Conservatives (
should ``
take RBS
a ``
position RBS
prior ``
to DT
the (
administration ``
's DT
year-end (
deadline ``
. DT

The (
issues ``
are DT

fighting RBS
over ``
the DT
size (
of ``
the DT
capital (

rather (
than ``
its RBS

If (
conservatives ``
do DT
n't (
support ``
an RBS
increase ``
in DT
the (
IMF ``

then (
it ``

Hudson (

An (

widening (
in ``

dragged DT
the (

Tuesday (

Soon (

the (

there (

The (

aggressive (

it DT
nevertheless (

the (

relaxed (

An (

at (

The (

VaxSyn (

has (
been ``
safely RBS
given ``
to DT
14 (
people ``
, DT
some (
of ``
whom DT
are (
experiencing ``
substantial RBS
increases ``
in DT
certain (
antibodies ``
. DT

`` (
The ``
conventional RBS
wisdom ``
used DT
to (
be ``
that DT
you (
could ``
n't DT
modify (
the ``
immune DT
response (
of ``
an DT
infected (
individual ``
'' DT
by (
innoculating ``
them DT

proteins (

demonstrated (
that ``
you DT

He (

certain RBS
volunteers ``
developed RBS
kinds ``

antibodies (
associated ``

early (

One (

mysteries (

why DT

large (

deteriorate (
nonetheless ``

Matra (

the DT

doubling (

Jaguar (
