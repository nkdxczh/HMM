greater VB

The ``
point MD

to MD

the CC

not ``

try VB

underreacting CC

the CC

expected CC

grow VB

At ``

half MD
that VB

will MD
have VB
come CC

The ``

up CC
by MD
the VB
proliferation MD

these CC
all-terrain MD

is CC
one MD
of VB
the CC
most MD
divisive VB
storms CC

blow VB
through MD
the VB
national CC

movement VB
in CC
recent MD
memory VB

sport VB
an CC
efficient MD

safe CC
, MD
fitness-promoting VB
way CC

get VB
back CC
to MD
nature VB
, CC
while MD
asserting VB
a CC
right MD
, VB
as CC
taxpayers MD

to MD
pedal VB
on CC
public MD
lands VB

But ``
the CC
bikes MD
' VB
burgeoning MD
numbers VB
, CC
safety MD
concerns VB
and MD
fear VB
that CC
they MD
damage VB
fragile CC
landscapes MD
have VB
prompted CC
pleas MD

from MD
the VB
Sierras CC
to MD
the VB
Eastern MD
Seaboard VB
, CC
to MD
ban VB
them CC
from MD
the VB
back CC
country MD
. DT

Key ``
to MD
the VB
issue CC
is MD
that VB
the CC
bikes MD
, VB
in CC
skillful MD
hands VB
, CC
can MD
go VB
virtually MD
anywhere VB
, CC
and MD
in VB
reckless MD
hands VB

Such ``

to MD
fly VB
down CC
treacherous MD
mountain VB
grades MD
at VB
speeds MD
of VB
up CC
to MD
40 VB
miles CC
an MD
hour VB
-- CC
a MD
thrill VB
for CC
the MD
cyclist VB
but CC
a MD
nightmare VB
for CC
unsuspecting MD
hikers VB
or CC
equestrians MD
. DT

For ``
harried MD
public-land VB
managers MD
across VB
the CC
nation MD
, VB
the CC
response MD
is VB
increasingly CC
to MD
shut VB
the CC
gates MD
. DT

The ``
state CC
of MD
California VB
, CC
following MD
the VB
lead MD
of VB
some CC
regional MD
parks VB
, CC
recently MD
adopted VB
regulations MD
that VB
closed CC
nearly MD
all VB
hiking MD
paths VB
in CC
state MD
parks VB
to MD
mountain VB
bicycles CC

The ``
move CC
largely MD
consigns VB
them CC

roads VB

motorized MD
vehicles VB

Most ``
other CC
states MD
have VB
enacted CC
similar MD
bans VB

The ``
bikes MD
are VB
unwelcome CC

Even ``
the CC
U.S. MD
Forest VB
Service MD
, VB
whose MD
lenient VB
`` CC
multiple-use MD
'' VB
philosophy CC
permits MD
motorized VB
vehicles CC

thousands VB

miles MD

its CC
trails MD
across VB
the CC
U.S. MD

has CC
begun VBN

major MD
portions VB
of CC
the ``
popular MD
Pacific VB
Crest CC
Trail MD
, VB
which CC
stretches MD
from VB
California CC
to MD
Canada VB
. DT

Often ``
these CC
closings MD
come VB
after CC
vigorous MD
anti-bike VB
lobbying MD
by VB
conservation CC
organizations MD
, VB
the CC
politically MD
potent VB
Sierra MD
Club VB
among MD
them VB

Sierra ``
has CC
been MD
instrumental VB
in CC
securing MD
a VB
number CC
of MD
the VB
California MD

It ``
has CC
been MD
waging VB
an CC
all-out MD
campaign VB

back CC

pushed MD
by VB

allow VB
the CC

designated MD
wilderness VB

where CC
they MD
are VB
now CC
prohibited MD

Yet MD
Sierra VB

hard-line MD
stance VB

created MD
something VB

which MD
estimates VB
that CC
17 MD
% VB
of CC
its MD
500,000 VB
members MD
own VB

bikes VB
. DT

Pressure MD
from VB
these CC
members MD
prompted VB
the CC
club MD
recently VB
to MD
soften VB
its CC
anti-bike MD
rhetoric VB
; MD
it VB
no CC
longer MD

lumps MD

into VB
the CC

The ``

In CC

a CC
future MD
Iranian VB
role CC
in MD
Afghanistan VB
in MD

for CC
Iranian MD
support VB

The ``

by VB
the CC
restoration MD
of VB

Shi'ite MD
Sultan VB

Keshtmand VB
to MD
the VB
Afghan CC
prime MD
ministry VB

Moreover MD
, VB
serious CC
questions MD
have VB
been CC
raised MD
about VB
the CC
claimed MD
withdrawal VB
of CC
Soviet MD
forces VB

Before ``
his MD
assassination VB
in CC
1988 MD
, VB
President CC
Zia MD
of VB
Pakistan CC
repeatedly MD
stated VB
that CC
fresh MD
Soviet VB
troops MD
were VB
being MD
inserted VB
into CC
Afghanistan MD
even VB
as CC
others MD
were VB
ostentatiously MD
withdrawn VB
. DT

Rep. ``
Bill MD
McCollum VB
-LRB- CC
R. MD
, VB
Fla. CC
-RRB- MD
reports VB
that CC
these MD
included VB
20,000 CC
to MD
30,000 VB
Soviet CC
Central MD
Asian VB
KGB CC
Border MD
Guards VB
, CC
ethnically MD
indistinguishable VB
from CC
Afghans MD
and VB
wearing CC
unmarked MD
uniforms VB
. DT

Meanwhile MD
, VB
the CC
Kabul MD
regime VB
is CC
increasingly MD
successful VB
at CC
portraying MD
the VB
resistance MD
as VB
bloody-minded MD
fanatics VB
. DT

In ``
this CC
they MD
are VB
aided CC
by MD
years VB
of CC
American MD
, VB
European CC
, MD
Pakistani VB
and CC
Saudi MD
support VB
for MD
the VB
most CC
extreme MD
factions VB
-- CC
radical MD
Islamic VB
fanatics CC
with MD
leaders VB
whose CC
policies MD
are VB
anathema CC
to MD
the VB
Afghan CC
public MD
. DT

This ``
heavy CC
outside MD
support VB
for CC
the MD
worst VB
has CC
undermined MD
better VB
, CC
moderate MD
leaders VB
. DT

In CC
autumn MD
last VB
year MD
, VB
for CC
example MD
, VB
the CC
regime MD
garrison VB
at CC
Kandahar MD
was VB
prepared CC
to MD
surrender VB
the CC
city ``
to MD
resistance VB
moderates MD
. DT

At ``
the CC
last MD
minute VB
, CC
however MD
, VB
Pakistani CC
officials MD
sent VB
in CC
Gulbuddin MD
Hekhmatyar VB
, CC
perhaps MD
the VB
most MD
hated VB
and CC
feared MD
of VB
the CC
extremists MD
, VB
with CC
a MD
demand VB
that CC
the ``
surrender MD
be VB
made CC
to MD
his VB
forces CC
. DT

The ``
deal MD
fell VB
through MD
, VB
and CC
Kandahar MD
remains VB
a CC
major MD
regime VB
base CC
. DT

The ``
resistance MD
lacks VB
not CC
only MD
air VB
power MD
, VB
armor CC
and MD
expertise VB
but CC
often MD
such VB
essentials CC
as MD
maps VB
, CC
mine MD
detectors VB
, CC
or MD
even VB
winter MD
gloves VB
. DT

Experienced ``
resistance MD
commanders VB
wanted CC
to MD
use VB
guerrilla MD
action VB
and CC
siege MD
tactics VB
to MD
wear VB
down CC
the MD
regime VB
. DT

Instead ``
, CC
they MD
were VB
pressured MD
by VB
Pakistan CC
's MD
ISI VB
, CC
the MD
channel VB
for CC
their MD
support VB
, CC
into ``
attacking MD
Jalalabad VB
. DT

They MD
took VB
more CC
than MD
25 VB
% MD
casualties VB
; CC
journalists MD
report VB
that CC
they MD
faced VB
minefields MD
without VB
mine MD
detectors VB
. DT

The ``
wonder VB
is CC
not MD
that VB
the CC
resistance MD
has VB
failed CC
to MD
topple VB
the CC
Kabul MD
regime VB
, CC
but ``
that MD
it VB
continues CC
to MD
exist VB
and CC
fight MD
at VB
all CC
. DT

Last ``
summer MD
, VB
in CC
response ``
to MD
congressional VB
criticism MD
, VB
the CC
State MD
Department VB
and CC
the MD
CIA VB
said CC
they MD
had VB
resumed CC
military MD
aid VB
to MD
the VB
resistance MD
months VB
after MD
it VB
was CC
cut MD
off VB
; CC
but MD
it VB
is CC
not MD
clear VB
how CC
much ``
is CC
being MD
sent VB
or CC
when MD
it VB
will MD
arrive VB
. DT

For ``
months CC
the MD
resistance VB
has CC
been MD
defenseless VB
against CC
air MD
attack VB
. DT

Thus ``
far MD
there VB
is CC
no MD
indication VB
that CC
they MD
have VB
been MD
re-supplied VB
with CC
Stingers MD
or VB
other CC
anti-aircraft MD
weapons VB
. DT

Indeed MD
, VB
U.S. CC
officials MD
have VB
indicated CC
to MD
the VB
press MD
that VB
the CC
continuation MD
of VB
aid CC
depends MD
on VB
what CC
success MD
the VB
weakened CC
resistance MD
achieves VB
by CC
the MD
end VB
of CC
this MD
year VB
. DT

Moscow ``
and MD
Kabul VB
must MD
have VB
found CC
that MD
information VB
useful MD
. DT

For ``
a MD
decade VB
U.S. MD
policy VB
has CC
been MD
incoherent VB
, CC
based MD
on VB
miscalculation CC
and MD
the VB
defense CC
of MD
bureaucratic VB
and CC
political MD
turf VB
. DT

No ``
settlement CC
negotiated MD
by VB
others CC
can MD
force VB
the CC
Afghan MD
people VB
to MD
give VB
up CC
their MD
struggle VB
. DT

A ``
cutoff MD
of VB
U.S. CC
military MD

would MD
merely VB
abandon MD

to MD
die VB
in CC

Mr. MD

quickly MD
ran VB
up CC
against MD
the VB
liberal CC
establishment MD

somehow VB
elevated MD

The ``

also VB

the MD
extent VB

any VB

plutonium CC

fear VB
that CC
if MD
the VB
shuttle MD

explode VB

if VB
Galileo MD
itself VB
crashes MD
into VB
the CC

during VB
the CC
two MD
times VB
it CC

close VB

fatal MD

atmosphere MD

It ``

few MD
years VB

only MD
a VB
civil CC
action MD

most CC

Yet ``
it CC

also VB
axiomatic CC

power CC

create VB

only CC
to MD
the VB
legislature MD

not ``

Beginning ``
in MD
the VB
early CC
19th MD
century VB
, CC
with MD
U.S. VB
v. MD
Hudson VB
and CC
Goodwin MD
, VB
the CC
Supreme MD
Court VB
has CC
repeatedly MD
held VB
that CC
a MD
judicial VB
power CC
to MD
declare VB
conduct CC
to MD
be VB
against MD
the VB
public MD
interest VB
and CC
hence MD
criminal VB
, CC
while MD
well VB
established MD
in VB
British MD
law VB
, CC
would MD
usurp VB
legislative MD
authority VB
under MD
the VB
doctrine CC

separation VB

powers MD

That ``

the VB
conventional CC
theory MD

In CC

however CC
, MD
the VB
line CC
between MD
interpretation VB
and CC
redefinition MD
of VB
the CC
criminal MD
law VB
long CC
ago MD
began VB
to MD
blur VB
. DT

In CC
particular MD
, VB
a CC
common MD
law VB
of CC
white-collar MD
crime VB
has CC
developed MD
with VB
surprising CC
rapidity MD
over VB
the CC
past MD
decade VB
. DT

For ``
example MD
, VB
although CC
insider MD
trading VB
has CC
long MD
been VB
criminal MD
, VB
it CC
has MD
never VB
been CC
statutorily MD
defined VB
. DT

In CC
1983 MD
, VB
the CC
Supreme MD
Court VB
tried CC
to MD
supply VB
a CC
workable MD
definition VB
in CC
the MD
Dirks VB
v. CC
SEC MD
decision VB
, CC
which MD
found VB
that CC
liability MD
depended VB
on CC
whether MD
the VB
tipper MD
had VB
breached CC
his MD
fiduciary VB
duty CC
to MD
the VB
corporation MD
in VB
order CC
to MD
obtain VB
`` CC
some ``
personal MD
gain VB
'' CC
and MD
whether VB
the CC
tippee MD
knew VB
or CC
recklessly MD
disregarded VB
this CC
fact MD
. DT

Gradually ``
, CC
however MD
, VB
lower MD
courts VB
and CC
prosecutors MD
have VB
pushed MD
this VB
definition CC
to MD
its VB
breaking MD
point VB
. DT

Consider ``
the CC
facts MD
underlying VB
the CC
1989 MD
conviction VB
of CC
Robert MD
Chestman VB
. DT

Prior ``
to MD
a VB
tender MD
offer VB
by MD
A&P VB
for CC
Waldbaum MD
Inc. VB
in CC
1986 MD
, VB
the CC
founder MD
of VB
the CC
Waldbaum MD

chain VB
called CC
an MD
elderly VB
relative CC
to MD
tell VB
her CC
to MD
assemble VB
her CC
stock MD
certificates VB
for CC

She ``
called MD
her VB
daughter CC
to MD
take VB
her CC
to MD
the VB
bank MD

who MD
, VB
in MD
turn VB
, CC
persuaded MD
her VB
husband MD
, VB
a CC
Mr. MD
Loeb VB

to MD
run VB
this CC
errand MD

Hearing ``
of CC
this MD
information VB
, CC
the MD
husband VB
discussed MD
it VB
with CC
his MD
broker VB
, CC
Mr. MD
Chestman VB
, CC
and ``
Mr. MD
Chestman VB
then CC
bought MD
for VB
his CC
own MD
account VB

other MD
clients VB

Basically ``
, CC
Mr. MD
Chestman VB
was CC
a MD
fourth-level VB
tippee MD

Did ``
Mr. MD

his MD
tipper VB

fiduciary CC
duty MD

how CC

only MD
hear VB
a CC

rumor VB
-LRB- MD
which VB

lawfully VB

The ``
line VB
seems CC
awfully MD
thin VB
for CC
criminal-law MD
purposes VB

A ``
second MD
illustration VB
is CC
supplied MD
by VB
the CC
recent MD
guilty VB
plea MD
entered VB
by CC
Robert MD
Freeman VB
, CC
formerly MD
head VB
of CC
arbitrage MD
at VB
Goldman MD

Essentially ``

Mr. MD
Freeman VB

invested MD
heavily VB
in CC
the MD
Beatrice VB

After ``
placing MD

Mr. MD

Mr. MD

asked CC
Mr. MD

who CC
his MD
source VB
was CC
and MD
, VB
on CC
hearing MD
that VB
it CC
was VBD
Bunny MD
Lasker VB

responded MD
: VB
`` CC
Well MD

'' NN

The ``
illegal MD
`` VB
tip MD
'' VB

the MD
bunny VB

was CC

largely VB
a CC
confirmation MD

gone CC

breach MD

Did ``
Mr. MD

have CC
notice MD

this CC

Finally ``

was MD
the VB
information CC
material MD

Yet ``

all MD
these VB

subsidiary CC

more CC
central MD

Who ``

who VB

the VB

It ``

decisions MD
in VB
very CC
different MD
ways VB
and CC
are MD
each VB
susceptible CC
to MD
very VB
different MD
kinds VB
of CC
errors MD
. DT

After-the-fact ``
judicial MD
examination VB
of CC
an MD
actor VB
's MD
conduct VB
has CC
always MD
been VB
the CC
common MD
law VB
's MD
method VB
. DT

When ``
only CC
civil MD
liability VB
is CC
involved MD
, VB
this CC
method MD
has VB
the CC
undeniable MD
strengths VB
of CC
factual MD
specificity VB
and CC
avoidance MD
of VB
overgeneralization CC
. DT

Still ``
, CC
case-by-case MD
retrospective VB
decision CC
making MD
of VB
this CC
sort MD
is VB
vulnerable CC
to MD
the VB
tunnel MD
vision VB
caused MD
by VB
a CC
fixation MD
on VB
ad CC
hoc MD
-LRB- VB
and CC
usually MD
sleazy VB
-RRB- MD
examples VB
. DT

When ``
a CC
court MD
decides VB
that CC
a MD
particular VB
actor CC
's MD
conduct VB
was MD
culpable VB
and CC
so MD
extends VB
the MD
definition VB
of CC
insider MD
trading VB
to MD
reach VB
this CC
conduct MD
, VB
it CC
does MD
not VB
see MD
the VB
potentially CC
enormous MD
number VB
of CC
other MD
cases VB
that CC
will MD
be VB
covered MD
by VB
the CC
expanded MD
rule VB
. DT

Thus ``
, CC
a MD
court VB
is CC
poorly MD
positioned VB
to MD
make VB
judgments MD
about VB
the CC
social MD
utility VB
of CC
the ``
expanded MD
rule VB
. DT

For ``
example MD
, VB
in CC
focusing MD
on VB
Mr. MD
Freeman VB
's MD
attempt VB
to MD
gain VB
nonpublic MD
information VB
about CC
a MD
deal VB
's CC
collapse MD
, VB
one CC
does MD
not VB
naturally MD
think VB
about CC
the MD
reverse VB
side MD
of VB
the CC
coin MD
: VB
What CC
if MD
the VB
rumor MD
had VB
been CC
false MD
? VB

Can ``
a CC
security MD
analyst VB
call CC
an MD
investment VB
banker CC
to MD
make VB
certain MD
that VB
a CC
seemingly MD
improbable VB
rumor CC
is MD
in VB
fact CC
false MD
? VB

In ``
the CC
past MD
, VB
not MD
only VB
would MD
reputable VB
professionals MD
have VB
rushed CC
to MD
check VB
out CC
such MD
rumors VB
with CC
the MD
company VB
, CC
but MD
companies VB
listed MD
on VB
the CC
major MD
stock VB
exchanges MD
were VB
encouraged CC
by MD
the VB
exchanges CC
to MD
respond VB
openly CC
to MD
such VB
inquiries CC
from MD
securities VB
analysts MD
. DT

Today MD
, VB
after CC
Mr. MD
Freeman VB
's CC
plea MD
, VB
there CC
is MD
an VB
uncertainty MD
that VB
is CC
both MD
unfair VB
and CC
inefficient MD
. DT

In ``
this CC
light MD
, VB
the CC
comparative MD
advantages VB
of CC
legislative MD
law-making VB
become MD
clear VB
: CC
-LRB- MD
1 VB
-RRB- CC
Before MD
it VB
acts MD
, VB
the CC
legislature MD
typically VB
will MD
hear VB
the CC
views MD
of VB
representatives MD
of VB
all CC
those MD
affected VB
by CC
its MD
decision VB
, CC
not MD
just VB
the CC
immediate MD
parties VB
before MD
the VB
court MD
; VB
and CC
-LRB- MD
2 VB
-RRB- MD
the VB
legislature CC
can MD
frame VB
`` CC
bright MD
line VB
'' MD
standards VB
that MD
create VB
less CC
uncertainty MD
than VB
the CC
fact-bound MD
decisions VB
of CC
courts MD
. DT

Although ``
legislative MD
lines VB
can MD
result VB
in CC
under-inclusion MD
-LRB- VB
which CC
explains MD
why VB
the CC
SEC MD
has VB
long MD
resisted VB
a CC
legislative MD
definition VB
of CC
insider MD
trading VB
-RRB- MD
, VB
judicial MD
lawmaking VB
inevitably CC
creates MD
uncertainty VB
because CC
of MD
the VB
shadowy CC
outer MD
edges VB
and CC
implications MD
of VB
most CC
judicial MD
decisions VB
. DT

At ``
least MD
when VB
the CC
stakes MD
are VB
high CC
, MD
uncertainty VB
in CC
turn MD
results VB
in CC
overinclusion MD
, VB
as CC
individuals MD
do VB
not MD
dare VB
to MD
approach VB
an CC
uncertain MD
line VB
closely CC
. DT

The ``
federal MD
mail VB
and CC
wire MD
fraud VB
statutes CC
provide MD
even VB
better CC
illustrations MD
of VB
the CC
rapid MD
evolution VB
of CC
a MD
federal VB
common MD
law VB
of CC
white-collar MD
crime VB
. DT

In CC
1987 MD
, VB
the CC
Supreme MD
Court VB
attempted CC
in MD
McNally VB
v. MD
U.S. VB
to MD
halt VB
the CC
inexorable MD
expansion VB
of CC
these MD
statutes VB
by MD
adopting VB
a MD
rule VB
of CC
strict MD
construction VB
for CC
ambiguous VBD
criminal MD
statues VB
. DT

Yet ``
, CC
late MD
last VB
year CC
, MD
Congress VB
effectively CC
reversed MD
this VB
decision CC
by MD
enacting VB
a CC
one-sentence MD
statute VB
that CC
defined MD
fraud VB
to MD
include VB
any MD
scheme VB
to MD
deprive VB
another CC
of MD
`` VB
the CC
intangible MD
right VB
of CC
honest MD
services VB
. DT
'' NN

At ``
a CC
stroke MD
, VB
this CC
may MD
criminalize VB
all CC
fiduciary MD
breaches VB
-LRB- CC
and MD
possibly VB
all CC
misrepresentations MD
by VB
an MD
agent VB
or CC
employee MD
-RRB- VB
. DT

Such ``
a CC
statute MD
illustrates VB
the CC
fundamental MD
problem VB
: CC
Congress MD
finds VB
it CC
is MD
easier VB
to MD
pass VB
sweepingly CC
moralistic MD
prohibitions VB
, CC
which MD
the VB
courts CC
must MD
thereafter VB
interpret MD
, VB
than CC
to MD
engage VB
in MD
the VB
difficult CC
line-drawing MD
distinctions VB
that CC
are MD
inherently VB
its MD
responsibility VB
. DT

We MD
are VB
confronted CC
less MD
with VB
a CC
judicial MD
power VB

than MD
with VB
a CC
legislative MD
giveaway VB
. DT

Predictably MD
, VB
when CC
confronted MD
with VB
morally CC
dubious MD
behavior VB

will MD
exploit VB
the CC

it MD

While ``
international MD

there MD

a CC
clear MD
economic VB
case CC

it VB

Opponents MD
of VB
the CC

argue VB
that CC
the ``
IMF MD
practices VB
central MD
planning VB
while CC
supporting MD
ineffective VB
governments MD
. DT

They ``
question MD
whether VB
the CC
IMF MD

any MD
role VB

given MD
its VB
original MD
mandate VB

Opponents MD
show VB
that CC
there MD

already CC
more MD

They ``
worry MD
that VB

which CC

the VB

themselves VB
into CC
despair MD
under VB

programs VB

Decisions ``
on MD
increases VB
in CC
the MD
IMF VB

capital MD

subsequent MD
authorization VB

a VB

it VB
to MD

The ``
politics MD
