In (
July $

Eastern (

its VBG
creditors (
agreed $
on VBG
a (
reorganization $
plan VBG
that (
called $
for VBG
Eastern (
to $
sell VBG
$ (
1.8 $
billion VBG
in (

and VBG
to (
emerge $
from VBG
bankruptcy-law (

caused (

Eastern (
ultimately $
decided VBG
it (
would $
have VBG
to (

operate (
the $

itself (

which VBG
would (
leave $
it VBG

would (
have $
to VBG
issue (
new $
debt VBG
to (
cover $
its VBG
costs (
, $
and VBG
that (
it $
would VBG
generate (

less VBG
cash (
than $
anticipated VBG

Other (

also VBG
would (
increase $

said (

From (

six (

, (
the $
number VBG
of (

in (

At (

The (

kicked VBG
up (
by VB
the (
proliferation $
of VBG
these (
all-terrain $
bicycles VBG
is (
one $
of VBG
the (
most $
divisive VBG
storms (

blow VBG
through (
the $
national VBG
conservation (

in VBG
recent (

Bikers (
-- $
many VBG
of (

ardent VBG
environmentalists (

proclaim VBG
their (

an VBG
efficient (
, $
safe VBG
, (
fitness-promoting $
way VBG
to (
get $
back VBG
to (
nature VB

while $
asserting VBG
a (
right $
, VBG
as (
taxpayers $

to (
pedal $
on VBG
public (

But (
the $
bikes VBG
' (
burgeoning $
numbers VBG
, (
safety $
concerns VBG
and (
fear $
that VBG
they (
damage $
fragile VBG
landscapes (

prompted VBG
pleas (

from VBG

Sierras $
to VBG
the (
Eastern $
Seaboard VBG
, (
to $
ban VBG
them (
from $
the VBG
back (
country $

Key (
to $
the VBG
issue (
is $
that VBG
the (
bikes $
, VBG
in (
skillful $
hands VBG
, (
can $
go VBG
virtually (
anywhere $
, VBG
and (
in $
reckless VBG
hands (
can $
become VBG
vehicles (

the $
top VBG
of (
a $

losing (

Such (
skills $
allow VBG
riders (

fly VBG
down (
treacherous $
mountain VBG
grades (
at $
speeds VBG
of (
up $
to VBG
40 (
miles $
an VBG
hour (
-- $
a VBG
thrill (
for $
the VBG
cyclist (
but $
a VBG
nightmare (
for $
unsuspecting VBG
hikers (
or $
equestrians VBG

For (
harried $
public-land VBG
managers (
across VB
the (
nation $
, VBG
the (
response $
is VBG
increasingly (
to $
shut VBG
the (
gates $
. CD

The (
state $
of VBG
California (
, $
following VBG
the (
lead $
of VBG
some (
regional $
parks VBG
, (
recently $
adopted VBG
regulations (
that $
closed VBG
nearly (
all $
hiking VBG
paths (
in VB
state (
parks $
to VBG
mountain (
bicycles $

The (
move $
largely VBG
consigns (
them $
to VBG
roads (
used $
by VBG
motorized (
vehicles $

Most (
other $
states VBG
have (
enacted VB
similar (
bans $

Even (
the VB
U.S. (
Forest $

, (
whose $
lenient VBG
`` (
multiple-use $
'' VBG
philosophy (
permits $
motorized VBG
vehicles (
on $
thousands VBG
of (
miles $
of VBG
its (
trails $
across VBG
the (
U.S. $

has (
begun $
to VBG
close (
some $
lands VBG
to (
the $
bikes VBG
, (
including $
major VBG
portions (
of $
the VBG
popular (
Pacific $
Crest VBG
Trail (
, $
which VBG
stretches (
from $
California VBG
to (
Canada $
. CD

Often (
these $
closings VBG
come (
after $
vigorous VBG
anti-bike (
lobbying VB
by (
conservation $
organizations VBG
, (
the $
politically VBG
potent (
Sierra $
Club VBG
among (
them $

Sierra (
has $
been VBG
instrumental (
in $
securing VBG
a (
number $
of VBG
the (
California $
bans VBG

It (
has $
been VBG
waging (
an $
all-out VBG
campaign (
to $
beat VBG
back (
a $
proposal VBG

pushed $
by VBG

allow VBG

wilderness (
areas $

where (
they $
are VBG
now (
prohibited $

Yet (
Sierra $

hard-line (
stance $
has VBG
created (
something $
of VBG
a (
rift $
in VBG
the (

which (
estimates $
that VBG
17 (
% $
of VBG
its (
500,000 $
members VBG
own (
mountain $
bikes VBG

Pressure (
from $
these VBG
members (
prompted $
the VBG
club (
recently $
to VBG
soften (
its $
anti-bike VBG
rhetoric (
; $
it VBG
no (
longer $

off-road (

But (
the $

still (

Meanwhile (

the VBG
Kabul (

increasingly (

at VBG
portraying (

such VBG

they VBG

The (
wonder $
is VBG
not (
that $
the VBG
resistance (
has $
failed VBG
to (
topple $
the VBG

taken (

He (
says $
the VBG
title (

his VBG

to VBG
make (
his $
point VBG
that (

have VBG
rights (
as $
individuals VBG

not $
as VBG
members (

His (

criticized VBG
the (
`` $
idiocy VBG

Instead (

said (

The (

that VBG

a VBG
black (

a $
triple VBG
threat (
to $
the VBG
liberal (
establishment $

Mr. (
Allen $
, VBG
who (
teaches $

at (

Harvey VBG

in VBG
California (

will VBG
remain (
a $
member VBG

spent VBG
years (
arguing $
that VBG
civil (

individuals (

rights VBG

He (
last VB
made (
waves $
when VBG
he (
dared $
to VBG
defend (
an $
Indian VBG
girl (
who $
had VBG
been (
adopted $
by VBG
non-Indian (
parents $
off VBG
her (
reservation $

Mr. (
Allen $
quickly VBG
ran (
up $
against VBG
the (
liberal $
establishment VBG
again (
, $
which VBG
somehow (
elevated $
the VBG
vague (
concept $
of VBG
`` (
Indian $

above VB
the (

the (
divisive $
litigation VBG
approach (
of $
the VBG

Indeed (
, $
the VBG
gap (
is $
so VBG
large (
that $
Mr. VBG
Allen (

critics VBG
refuse (
to $
engage VBG

a (

years VBG

only $
a VBG
civil (
action $
at VBG
most (
would $
have VBG
been (
brought $

Yet (
it $
is VBG
also (
axiomatic $
that VBG
the (

create (

belongs (
only $

the (

not VBG

Beginning (

the (

with VBG
U.S. (
v. $
Hudson VBG

Goodwin $

the (
Supreme $

has (
repeatedly $
held VBG
that (
a $
judicial VBG
power (
to $
declare VBG
conduct (
to $
be VBG
against (
the $
public VBG
interest (
and $
hence VBG
criminal (

while VBG
well (

would (

however (

the VBG
line (

the (
criminal $
law VBG
long (

began VBG
to (
blur $

In (
particular $

a (

law VBG
of (
white-collar $

has (
developed $
with VBG
surprising (
rapidity $
over VBG
the (
past $
decade VBG

For (
example $
, VBG
although (
insider $
trading VBG
has (
long $
been VBG
criminal (
, $
it VBG
has (
never $
been VBG
statutorily (
defined $
. CD

In (
1983 VB
, (
the $
Supreme VBG
Court (
tried $
to VBG
supply (
a $
workable VBG
definition (
in $
the VBG
Dirks (
v. $
SEC VBG
decision (
, $
which VBG
found (
that $
liability VBG
depended (
on $
whether VBG
the (
tipper $
had VBG
breached (
his $
fiduciary VBG
duty (
to $
the VBG
corporation (
in $
order VBG
to (
obtain $
`` VBG

whether VBG
the (

recklessly $
disregarded VBG
this (
fact $

Gradually (
, $
however VBG
, (
lower $
courts VBG

have VBG
pushed (
this $

to (
its VB

the $
founder VBG
of (
the $
Waldbaum VBG
's (
supermarket $
chain VBG
called (
an $
elderly VBG
relative (
to $
tell VBG
her (
to $
assemble VBG
her (
stock $
certificates VBG
for (
delivery $
. CD

She (
called $
her VBG
daughter (
to $
take VBG
her (
to $
the VBG
bank (
, $
who VBG
, (
in $
turn VBG
, (
persuaded $
her VBG
husband (
, $
a VBG
Mr. (
Loeb VB
, (
to $
run VBG
this (
errand $
. CD

Hearing (
of VB
this (
information $
, VBG
the (
husband $
discussed VBG
it (
with $
his VBG
broker (
, $
Mr. VBG
Chestman (
, $
and VBG
Mr. (
Chestman $
then VBG
bought (
for $
his VBG
own (
account $
and VBG
other (
clients $
. CD

Basically (
, $
Mr. VBG
Chestman (
was $
a VBG
fourth-level (
tippee $
. CD

Did (
Mr. $
Loeb VBG
, (
his $
tipper VBG
, (
breach $
a VBG
fiduciary (
duty $
-LRB- VBG
and (
, $
if VBG
so (
, $
to VBG
whom (
-RRB- $
? CD

Did (
Mr. $
Loeb VBG
seek (
personal $
gain VBG
-LRB- (
and $
if VBG
so (
, VB
how (
-RRB- $
? CD

Or (
did $
Mr. VBG
Chestman (
only $
hear VBG
a (
market $
rumor VBG
-LRB- (
which $
one VBG
may (
lawfully $
trade VBG
upon (
-RRB- $
? CD

The (
line $
seems VBG
awfully (
thin $
for VBG
criminal-law (
purposes $
. CD

A (
second $
illustration VBG
is (
supplied $
by VBG
the (
recent $
guilty VBG
plea (
entered $
by VBG
Robert (
Freeman VB
, (
formerly $
head VBG
of (
arbitrage $
at VBG
Goldman (
, $
Sachs VBG
& (
Co $
. CD

Essentially (
, VB
Mr. (
Freeman $
had VBG
invested (
heavily $
in VBG
the (
Beatrice $
leveraged VBG
buy-out (
, $
when VBG
he (
was $
told VBG
by (
another $
prominent VBG
trader (
, $
Bernard VBG
`` (
Bunny $
'' VBG
Lasker (
, $
that VBG
the (
deal $
was VBG
in (
trouble $
. CD

After (
placing $
orders VBG
to (
sell $
, VBG
Mr. (
Freeman $
called VBG
Martin (
Siegel $
, VBG
an (
investment $
banker VBG
at (
Kidder $
, VBG
Peabody (
& $
Co. VBG
, (
who $
was VBG
advising (
on $
the VBG
deal (
, $
to VBG
confirm (
these $
rumors VBG
. ,

Mr. (
Siegel $
asked VBG
Mr. (
Freeman $
who VBG
his (
source $
was VBG
and (
, $
on VBG
hearing (
that $
it VBG
was (
Bunny $
Lasker VBG
, (
responded $
: VBG
`` (
Well VB
, (
your $
bunny VBG
has (
a $
good VBG
nose (
. $
'' CD

The (
illegal VB
`` (
tip $
'' VBG
of (
the $
bunny VBG
's (
good $
nose VBG
was (
then $
largely VBG
a (
confirmation $
of VBG
rumors (
already $
known VBG
to (
many $
in VBG
the (
market $
. CD

Had (
the $
case VBG
gone (
to $
trial VBG
the (
same $
issues VBG
would (
have $
surfaced VBG
: ,

Was (
there $
a VBG
fiduciary (
breach $
in VBG
order (
to $
obtain VBG
personal (
gain $
? CD

Did (
Mr. $
Freeman VBG
have (
notice VB
of (
this $
? CD

Finally (
, $
was VBG
the (
information $
material VBG
? ,

Yet (
, $
all VBG
these (
issues $
are VBG
subsidiary (
to $
a VBG
more (
central $
issue VBG
: (
Who $
is VBG
and (
who $
should VBG
be (
making $
the VBG
criminal (
law $
here VBG
? ,

It (
is VB
not (
my $
contention VBG
that (
either $
Mr. VBG
Chestman (
or $
Mr. VBG
Freeman (
was $
an VBG
innocent (
victim $
of VBG
prosecutorial (
overzealousness $
. CD

Arguably (
, $
both VBG
were (
on VB
notice (
that $
their VBG
behavior (
was $
at VBG
least (
risky $
. CD

But (
even $
if VBG
they (
behaved $
recklessly VBG
, (
reasons $
still VBG
exist (
to $
fear VBG
and (
resist $
this VBG
steady (
process $
of VBG
case-by-case (
judicial $
extension VBG
of (
the $
law VBG
of (
insider $
trading VBG
. ,

Courts (
and $
legislatures VBG
make (
decisions $
in VBG
very (
different $
ways VBG
and (
are VB
each (
susceptible $
to VBG
very (
different $
kinds VBG
of (
errors $
. CD

After-the-fact (
judicial $
examination VBG
of (
an $
actor VBG
's (
conduct VB
has (
always $
been VBG
the (
common $
law VBG
's (
method $
. CD

When (
only $
civil VBG
liability (
is $
involved VBG
, (
this $
method VBG
has (
the $
undeniable VBG
strengths (
of $
factual VBG
specificity (
and $
avoidance VBG
of (
overgeneralization $
. CD

Still (
, $
case-by-case VBG
retrospective (
decision $
making VBG
of (
this $
sort VBG
is (
vulnerable $
to VBG
the (
tunnel $
vision VBG
caused (
by VB
a (
fixation $
on VBG
ad (
hoc $
-LRB- VBG
and (
usually $
sleazy VBG
-RRB- (
examples $
. CD

When (
a $
court VBG
decides (
that $
a VBG
particular (
actor $
's VBG
conduct (
was $
culpable VBG
and (
so $
extends VBG
the (
definition $
of VBG
insider (
trading $
to VBG
reach (
this $
conduct VBG
, (
it $
does VBG
not (
see $
the VBG
potentially (
enormous $
number VBG
of (
other $
cases VBG
that (
will $
be VBG
covered (
by $
the VBG
expanded (
rule $
. CD

Thus (
, $
a VBG
court (
is $
poorly VBG
positioned (
to $
make VBG
judgments (
about $
the VBG
social (
utility $
of VBG
the (
expanded $
rule VBG
. ,

For (
example $
, VBG
in (
focusing $
on VBG
Mr. (
Freeman $
's VBG
attempt (
to $
gain VBG
nonpublic (
information $
about VBG
a (
deal $
's VBG
collapse (
, $
one VBG
does (
not $
naturally VBG
think (
about VB
the (
reverse $
side VBG
of (
the $
coin VBG
: (
What $
if VBG
the (
rumor $
had VBG
been (
false $
? CD

Can (
a $
security VBG
analyst (
call $
an VBG
investment (
banker $
to VBG
make (
certain $
that VBG
a (
seemingly $
improbable VBG
rumor (
is $
in VBG
fact (
false $
? CD

In (
the $
past VBG
, (
not $
only VBG
would (
reputable $
professionals VBG
have (
rushed $
to VBG
check (
out $
such VBG
rumors (
with $
the VBG
company (
, $
but VBG
companies (
listed $
on VBG
the (
major $
stock VBG
exchanges (
were $
encouraged VBG
by (
the $
exchanges VBG
to (
respond $
openly VBG
to (
such $
inquiries VBG
from (
securities $
analysts VBG
. ,

Today (
, $
after VBG
Mr. (
Freeman $
's VBG
plea (
, $
there VBG
is (
an $
uncertainty VBG
that (
is $
both VBG
unfair (
and $
inefficient VBG
. ,

In (
this $
light VBG
, (
the $
comparative VBG
advantages (
of $
legislative VBG
law-making (
become $
clear VBG
: (
-LRB- $
1 VBG
-RRB- (
Before $
it VBG
acts (
, $
the VBG
legislature (
typically $
will VBG
hear (
the $
views VBG
of (
representatives $
of VBG
all (
those $
affected VBG
by (
its $
decision VBG
, (
not $
just VBG
the (
immediate $
parties VBG
before (
the $
court VBG
; (
and $
-LRB- VBG
2 (
-RRB- $
the VBG
legislature (
can $
frame VBG
`` (
bright $
line VBG
'' (
standards $
that VBG
create (
less $
uncertainty VBG
than (
the $
fact-bound VBG
decisions (
of $
courts VBG
. ,

Although (
legislative $
lines VBG
can (
result $
in VBG
under-inclusion (
-LRB- $
which VBG
explains (
why $
the VBG
SEC (
has $
long VBG
resisted (
a $
legislative VBG
definition (
of $
insider VBG
trading (
-RRB- $
, VBG
judicial (
lawmaking $
inevitably VBG
creates (
uncertainty $
because VBG
of (
the $
shadowy VBG
outer (
edges $
and VBG
implications (
of $
most VBG
judicial (
decisions $
. CD

At (
least $
when VBG
the (
stakes $
are VBG
high (
, $
uncertainty VBG
in (
turn $
results VBG
in (
overinclusion $
, VBG
as (
individuals $
do VBG
not (
dare $
to VBG
approach (
an $
uncertain VBG
line (
closely $
. CD

The (
federal $
mail VBG
and (
wire $
fraud VBG
statutes (
provide $
even VBG
better (
illustrations $
of VBG
the (
rapid $
evolution VBG
of (
a $
federal VBG
common (
law $
of VBG
white-collar (
crime $
. CD

In (
1987 $
, VBG
the (
Supreme $
Court VBG
attempted (
in $
McNally VBG
v. (
U.S. $
to VBG
halt (
the $
inexorable VBG
expansion (
of $
these VBG
statutes (
by $
adopting VBG
a (
rule $
of VBG
strict (
construction $
for VBG
ambiguous (
criminal $
statues VBG
. ,

Yet (
, $
late VBG
last (
year $
, VBG
Congress (
effectively $
reversed VBG
this (
decision $
by VBG
enacting (
a $
one-sentence VBG
statute (
that $
defined VBG
fraud (
to $
include VBG
any (
scheme $
to VBG
deprive (
another $
of VBG
`` (
the $
intangible VBG
right (
of $
honest VBG
services (

'' CD

At (
a $
stroke VBG
, (
this $
may VBG
criminalize (
all $
fiduciary VBG
breaches (
-LRB- $
and VBG
possibly (
all $
misrepresentations VBG
by (
an $
agent VBG
or (
employee $
-RRB- VBG
. ,

Such (
a $
statute VBG
illustrates (
the $
fundamental VBG
problem (
: $
Congress VBG
finds (
it $
is VBG
easier (
to $
pass VBG
sweepingly (
moralistic $
prohibitions VBG
, (
which $
the VBG
courts (
must $
thereafter VBG
interpret (
, $
than VBG
to (
engage $
in VBG
the (
difficult $
line-drawing VBG
distinctions (
that $
are VBG
inherently (
its $
responsibility VBG

We (
are $
confronted VBG
less (
with $
a VBG
judicial (
power $

with $
a VBG
legislative (
giveaway $

At (
the $
recent VBG
meetings (
of $
the VBG
World (
Bank $
and VBG
International (
Monetary $
Fund VBG
, (
the $
Bush VBG
administration (
announced $
its VBG
intention (
to $
decide VBG
by (
yearend $
the VBG
size (
of $
the VBG

not (

in (

IMF VBG
's (

for VBG
a (
doubling $

its (
$ $
90 VBG
billion (
capital $
, VBG
the (
administration $
probably VBG
will (
agree $
to VBG
a (
multibillion-dollar $
increase VBG

This (
would $
be VBG
consistent (
with $
its VBG
unwavering (
support $
for VBG
the (
Brady $
Plan VBG
and (
G-7 $
exchange-rate VBG
intervention (

and VBG
with (
its $
financial VBG
commitment (
to $
Mexico VBG
, (
Poland VB
and (
others $

The (
IMF $
has VBG
several (
reasons $
for VBG
requesting (
the $
increase VBG

Its (
role $
in VBG
the (
economies $
of VBG
developing (
countries $
has VBG
grown (
steadily $
since VBG
the (
1970s $

which VBG
promises (
larger $
and VBG
earlier (
disbursements $
to VBG
approved (
countries $

At (
least $
three VBG
other (
factors $
have VBG
encouraged (
the $
IMF VBG
to (
insist $
on VBG
increased (
capital $
. CD

First (
, $
it VBG
argues (
that $
its VBG
capital (
base $
must VBG
be (
increased $
in VBG
order (
to $
maintain VBG
its (
size $
relative VBG
to (
world $
financial VBG
markets (
, $
for VBG
which (
it $
feels VBG
some (
responsibility $
. CD

Second (
, $
the VBG
World (
Bank $
's VBG
recent (
$ $
75 VBG
billion (
capital $
increase VBG
-- (
$ $
14 VBG
billion (
from $
the VBG
U.S. (
-- $
has VBG
left (
the $
IMF VBG
feeling (
less $
than VBG
first (
fiddle $
among VBG
international (
financial $
institutions VBG
. ,

Third (
, VB
the (
IMF $
would VBG
like (
to $
meet VBG
Japan (
's $
request VBG
for (
increased $
ownership VBG
-LRB- (
currently $
4.5 VBG
% (
-RRB- $
. CD

Japan (
has $
supported VBG
a (
larger $
role VBG
for (
the $
IMF VBG
in (
developing-country $
debt VBG
issues (
, $
and VBG
is (
an $
important VBG
financial (
resource $
for VBG
IMF-guided (
programs $
in VBG
developing (
countries $
. CD

While (
international $
politics VBG
may (
argue $
for VBG
the (
capital $
increase VBG
, (
there $
is VBG
a (
clear $
economic VBG
case (
against $
it VBG
. ,

Opponents (
of $
the VBG
increase (
argue $
that VBG
the (
IMF $
practices VBG
central (
planning $
while VBG
supporting (
ineffective $
governments VBG
. ,

They (
question $
whether VBG
the (
IMF $
has VBG
any (
role $
in VBG
developing (
countries $
, VBG
given (
its $
original VBG
mandate (
to $
assist VBG
industrial (
countries $
in VBG
balance-of-payments (
emergencies $
. CD

Opponents (
show $
that VBG
there (
are $
already VBG
more (
funds $
available VBG
than (
commendable VB
reform (
efforts $
. CD

They (
worry $
that VBG
new (
IMF $
funding VBG
of (
developing $
countries VBG
will (
simply $
end VBG
up (
substituting $
IMF VBG
debt (
for $
reschedulable VBG
commercial (
bank $
debt VBG
, (
a $
bad VBG
trade (
all $
around VBG
. ,

They (
believe $
microeconomics VBG
, (
which $
addresses VBG
the (
problems $
of VBG
markets (
, $
investment VBG
climate (
and $
management VBG
practices (
, $
is VBG
the (
key $
to VBG
developing-country (
growth $
, VBG
not (
the $
IMF VBG
's (
Keynesian $
focus VBG
on (
trade $
deficits VBG
, (
quarterly $
targets VBG
and (
government $
debt VBG
. ,

They (
point $
at VBG
the (
numerous $
developing-country VBG
governments (
that $
have VBG
inflated (
, $
taxed VBG
and (
regulated $
themselves VBG
into (
despair $
under VBG
successive (
IMF $
programs VBG
. ,

Decisions (
on $
increases VBG
in (
the $
IMF VBG
's (
capital $
base VBG
traditionally (
are $
made VBG
by (
the $
administration VBG
, (
with $
subsequent VBG
authorization (
by $
Congress VBG
. ,

The (
last VB
U.S. (
congressional $
authorization VBG
, (
in $
1983 VBG
, (
was $
a VBG
political (
donnybrook $
and VBG
carried (
a $
$ VBG
6 (
billion $
housing VBG
program (
along $
with VBG
it (
to $
secure VBG
adequate (
votes $
. CD

The (
politics $
of VBG
the (
1990 $
congressional VBG
authorization (
are $
likely VBG
to (
be $
similar VBG
to (
those $
of VBG
previous (
authorizations $
. CD

Liberals (
may $
support VBG
the (
stabilizing VB
, (
quasi-governmental $
role VBG
of (
the $
IMF VBG
on (
two $
conditions VBG
: (
that $
the VBG

assurances VBG
that (

not (
be $
used VBG
against (

re-election $

; (
and $
that VBG
the (
legislation $
address VBG
-- (
with $
dollars VBG
-- (
social $
and VBG
environmental (
concerns $
. CD

Conservative (
Republicans $
will VBG
be (
given $
the VBG
choice (
of $
supporting VBG
or (
fighting $
their VBG
party (

popular VBG

in $

A (
U.S. $

to (
refuse $
the VBG
IMF (
its $
capital VBG
increase (
, $
or VBG
limit (
it $
to VBG
25 (
% $

would (
bring $
a VBG
major (
change $
in VBG
international (
economic $
policy VBG
, (
and VB
could (
not $
be VBG
taken (
lightly $

implications VBG
for (
the $
G-7 VBG
coordination (
process $
and VBG
the (
stability $
of VBG
world (
financial $
markets VBG

Because (
commercial $
banks VBG
and (
the $
developing-country VBG
governments (
believe $
they VBG
will (
get $
a VBG
piece (
of $
any VBG
capital (
increase $
, VBG
a (
scaled-down $
IMF VBG
mission (
would $
leave VBG
both (
feeling $
shortchanged VBG

Furthermore (
, $
a VBG
U.S. (
rejection $
of VBG
the (
capital $
increase VBG
-LRB- (
and $
transfer VBG
of (
shares $

Japan (
-RRB- $
would VBG
give (
Japan $
an VBG
argument (
against VB

burden-sharing $
. CD

On (
the VB
other (
hand $
, VBG
a (
decision $
to VBG
increase (
the $
IMF VBG
's (
capital $
would VBG
reinforce (
the $
central VBG
economic (
role $
of VBG
multilateral (
institutions $
in VBG
developing (
countries $

With (
the $
increase VBG
, (
even $
more VBG
developing-country (
energy $

talent (
would $
be VBG
diverted (

IMF-approved VBG
economic (

Upping (
the $
ante VBG

slow $
economic VBG

further VBG

delay (
market-opening $
