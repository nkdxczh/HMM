`` DT
My DT

The DT

that ''

In DT

a (

according ''
to TO
a (

Embassy ''
cable ''
from ''

The DT

But DT
U.S. DT
intelligence ''

rather ''
than ''

in IN
or ''
cut ''
loose ''
its ''

merely ''
filed ''
the DT
report ''
away NN

Mr. DT
Noriega DT

tips ''
on ''
emerging ''
leftists ''
at ''
his ''
school ''
were ''
deemed ''
more ''
important ''
to TO
U.S. DT
interests NN

From DT
that ''
point ''

, ,
the DT
U.S. DT
would ''
make ''
a (
practice ''
of IN
overlooking ''
the DT
Panamanian DT

misadventures NN

The DT
U.S. DT
has ''
befriended ''
and CC
later ''
turned ''
against ''
many ''
dictators ''

but ''
none ''
quite ''
so ''
resourceful NN

The DT
55-year-old ''
Mr. DT

is ''

as ''

Yet DT
he ''
has ''
proved ''
more ''
resilient ''
than ''
any ''
of IN
them NN

And DT
out ''
of IN

The DT
U.S. DT
can ''
make ''
mistakes ''
and CC
still ''
hope ''
to TO
remove ''
him ''

`` DT

`` DT

Mr. DT

Mr. DT

might ''

says ''
Mr. DT

only ''
given ''
him ''

Perhaps DT

Tony DT

older ''
than ''

of IN
his ''

and CC
gained ''
admission ''
to TO
the DT
academy ''
because ''
his ''

falsified ''

He DT
considered ''
himself ''
intellectually ''
superior ''
to TO

many ''

`` DT

Mr. DT

in IN
either ''

His DT
commanding ''
officer ''
at ''

Major DT
Omar ''
Torrijos ''

gave ''
him ''
an ''

assignment NN
: .
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
would ''
organize ''
the DT
province ''

intelligence ''
service NN

The DT
spy ''

the DT

opponents ''
in IN

at ''

United DT
Fruit DT
was ''
one ''
of IN
the DT
two ''
largest ''
contributors ''
to TO

national ''
income NN

Satisfying DT
its ''
interests ''
was ''
a (
priority ''
for ''
any ''
Panamanian DT
leader NN

Mr. DT
Noriega DT
's POS
initial ''
retainer ''
was ''
only ''
$ ''
50 ''
to TO
$ ''
100 ''
a (
month ''

plus ''
occasional ''
gifts ''
of IN
liquor ''
or ''
groceries ''
from ''
the DT
American ''
PX ''
, ,
a (
former ''
intelligence ''
official ''
says NN

It DT
was ''
modest ''
pay ''
by ''
American ''
standards ''
, ,
but ''
a (
healthy ''
boost ''
to TO
his ''
small ''
military ''
salary ''
, ,
which ''
fellow ''
officers ''
remember ''
as ''
having ''
been ''
$ ''
300 ''
to TO
$ ''
400 ''
monthly NN

`` DT
He DT
did ''
it ''
very ''
well ''

Boris ''
Martinez ''

a (
former ''
Panamanian DT
colonel ''
who ''
managed ''
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
and CC
his ''
operation NN

`` DT
He DT
started ''
building ''
the DT
files ''
that ''
helped ''
him ''
gain ''
power NN

'' .

A DT
National DT

job ''
assumed ''
by ''
Capt. ''

in IN
1964 ''

as ''
chief ''
of IN
the DT
transit ''
police ''
in IN
David DT
City DT
, ,
capital ''
of IN
the DT
Chiriqui ''
Province ''
-- DT
was ''
tailor-made ''
for ''
an ''
aspiring ''
super-spy NN
. .

By DT
pressuring ''
taxi ''
and CC
bus ''
drivers ''
who ''
needed ''
licenses ''
, ,
he ''
gained ''
a (
ready ''
cache ''
of IN
information NN

He DT
knew ''
which ''
local ''
luminaries ''
had ''
been ''
caught ''
driving ''
drunk ''
, ,
which ''
had ''
been ''
found ''
with ''

mistresses NN

This DT
proved ''
particularly ''
valuable ''
to TO
the DT
Panamanian DT
government ''
in IN
1967 ''
, ,
when ''
union ''
leaders ''
were ''
planning ''
a (
May ''
Day ''
march ''
that ''
the DT
government ''
feared ''
could ''
turn ''
violent NN

Mr. DT

had ''
learned ''
that ''
a (
local ''
union ''
leader ''
was ''
sleeping ''
with ''
the DT
wife ''
of IN
his ''
deputy NN

So DT
he ''
splashed ''
the DT
information ''
on ''
handbills ''
that ''
he ''
distributed ''
throughout ''
the DT
banana-exporting ''
city ''
of IN
Puerto ''
Armuelles ''
, ,
which ''
was ''
ruled ''
by ''
United DT
Fruit DT

The DT
campaign ''
so ''
divided ''
union ''
leaders ''
that ''
the DT
government ''
found ''
them ''
far ''
easier ''
to TO
control NN

`` DT
It DT
was ''
like ''

Mr. DT

`` DT
Noriega DT

He DT
was ''

During DT
his ''

however ''

Mr. DT

also ''
revealed ''
himself ''
as ''

he ''
was ''
ingenious NN

Rodrigo DT
Miranda ''

a (
local ''

recalls ''
an ''

Noriega DT
visiting ''
prisoners ''
in IN

at ''
the DT
5th ''
Zone ''
Garrison ''
headquarters ''
in IN
David DT

where ''
he ''
had ''
his ''
offices NN

Mr. DT

would ''
order ''

take ''
off ''

run ''
around ''
the DT
courtyard ''
naked ''

laughing ''
at ''

then ''
retreating ''
to TO

`` DT
People DT
started ''
wondering ''
if ''
something ''

Mr. DT

But DT
through ''
this ''
period ''

so ''

as ''

U.S. DT

was ''
concerned ''

Mr. DT
Noriega DT
was ''
a (

He DT
signed ''

counter-intelligence ''

American ''
officers ''
at ''

of IN
a (
1983 ''

He DT
flew ''

for ''

Some DT

interpreted ''
his ''
eagerness ''
and CC
studiousness ''
as ''
a (
sign ''
of IN
loyalty ''

but ''
they ''
did ''
so ''
falsely NN

He DT
rose ''
to TO
chief ''
of IN

in IN

critical ''

the DT

Mr. DT

intelligence ''
experts ''
always ''
insisted ''

`` DT

`` DT
Some DT

Even DT

One DT

five ''
options ''
for ''

at ''

on ''
the DT
drug ''
ties ''
of IN
Panamanian DT
officials ''

Mr. DT

`` DT
Everybody ''

Mr. DT

Mr. DT
Noriega DT
became ''
an ''
even ''
greater ''
threat ''
in IN
1976 ''

when ''

The DT
U.S. DT

And DT
the DT

At DT

the DT

was ''
once ''

flirting ''

Mr. DT

It DT
was ''

The DT

was ''
passed ''
to TO
Mr. DT

by ''

that ''

On DT

Prosecutors DT
in IN

received ''

another ''

But DT
now ''

along ''

Mr. DT

they ''

illegal ''

In DT
January ''

Panamanian DT

granted ''

Mr. DT

It DT

much ''
less ''
Mr. DT
Noriega DT

the DT

was ''
told NN

After DT
prodding ''
from ''
Mr. DT

U.S. DT
Attorney ''
Jack ''
Eskenazi ''
pleaded ''
with ''
Justice ''
Department ''
officials ''
in IN

to TO
let ''

`` DT
Unfortunately ''

'' .
Mr. DT
Eskenazi ''
wrote ''
in IN
a (
letter ''

`` DT
those ''

The DT

`` DT

`` DT
If DT

In DT
August ''
1983 ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
took ''
over ''
as ''
General ''
and CC
de-facto ''
dictator ''
of IN
Panama ''
, ,
having ''
maneuvered ''
his ''
way ''
to TO
the DT
top ''
only ''
two ''

after ''
the DT
mysterious ''
death ''
in IN
a (
plane ''
crash ''
of IN
his ''
old ''
boss ''
Omar ''
Torrijos NN
. .

Soon DT
, ,
the DT
military ''
became ''
a (
veritable ''
mafia ''
controlling ''
legal ''
and CC
illegal ''
businesses NN
. .

The DT
Reagan ''
administration ''
also ''
put ''
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
's POS
G-2 ''
back ''
on ''
the DT
U.S. DT
payroll NN

Payments DT
averaged ''
nearly ''

200,000 ''
a (
year ''
from ''
the DT
U.S. DT
Defense DT
Intelligence DT
Agency ''
and CC
the DT
CIA NN

Although DT
working ''
for ''
U.S. DT
intelligence ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
was ''
hardly ''
helping ''
the DT
U.S. DT
exclusively NN

During DT
the DT
Reagan ''
years ''
he ''
expanded ''
his ''
business ''
and CC
intelligence ''
contacts ''
with ''
the DT
Cubans ''
and CC
the DT
Sandinistas NN

He DT
allegedly ''
entered ''
into ''

first ''
formal ''

with ''

according ''
to TO
Floyd ''

a (

who ''
once ''
worked ''

Mr. DT

who ''
testified ''
before ''

U.S. DT
grand ''
jury ''
in IN
Miami ''
that ''
would ''
ultimately ''
indict ''
the DT
Panamanian DT
on ''
drug ''
charges NN
. .

But DT
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
was ''
convinced ''
the DT
Reagan ''
White DT
House DT
would ''
n't ''
act ''
against ''
him ''
, ,
recalls ''
his ''
close ''
ally ''
Jose ''
Blandon ''
, ,
because ''
he ''
had ''
an ''
insurance ''
policy NN
: .
his ''
involvement ''
with ''
the DT
Contra ''
rebels ''
in IN
Nicaragua NN
. .

Mr. DT
Blandon ''
says ''
the DT
general ''
allowed ''
the DT
Contras ''
to TO
set ''
up ''
a (
secret ''
training ''
center ''
in IN
Panama NN
. .

Mr. DT
Noriega DT
also ''
conveyed ''
intelligence ''
from ''
his ''
spy ''
operation ''
inside ''
the DT
Nicaraguan ''
capital ''
of IN
Managua NN

And DT
on ''
at ''

one ''
occasion ''

in IN
the DT
spring ''
of IN
1985 ''
, ,
he ''
helped ''
arrange ''
a (
sabotage ''
attack ''
on ''
a (
Sandinista ''
arsenal ''
in IN
Nicaragua NN

Although DT
, ,
his ''
help ''
for ''
the DT

cause ''
was ''
limited ''
, ,
it ''
was ''
enough ''
to TO
win ''
him ''
important ''

like ''

he ''
says NN

An DT
incident ''
in IN
1984 ''
suggested ''
one ''
additional ''
means ''
by ''
which ''
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
might ''
have ''
maintained ''
such ''
influence ''
with ''
Washington ''
-- DT
by ''
compromising ''
U.S. DT
officials NN

Curtin DT
Windsor ''

then ''
the DT

Mr. DT

of IN
the DT

`` DT

He DT
says ''
Mr. DT

he ''

in IN

the DT

Mr. DT

National DT

could ''

As DT
Mr. DT
Noriega DT

political ''
troubles ''
grew ''
, ,
so ''
did ''
his ''
offers ''
of IN
assistance ''
to TO
the DT
Contras ''
, ,
an ''
apparent ''
attempt ''
to TO
curry ''
more ''
favor ''
in IN
Washington NN

For DT

he ''
helped ''
steal ''
the DT
May ''
1984 ''
Panamanian DT
elections ''
for ''
the DT
ruling ''
party NN

But DT
just ''
one ''

he ''
also ''
contributed ''

100,000 ''
to TO
a (

according ''
to TO
documents ''
released ''
for ''

trial ''
in IN
Washington ''

D.C NN

Yet DT
, ,
his ''
political ''
setbacks ''
mounted NN

Mr. DT
Noriega DT
was ''
accused ''
of IN
ordering ''
in IN
1985 ''
the DT
beheading ''
of IN
Hugo ''
Spadafora ''
, ,
his ''
most ''
outspoken ''
political ''
opponent ''
and CC
the DT
first ''
man ''
to TO
publicly ''
finger ''
Mr. DT

on ''

trafficking ''
charges NN

He DT
then ''
ousted ''

Barletta ''

a (
former ''
World ''
Bank DT
official ''
with ''
close ''

U.S. DT

after ''
Mr. DT
Barletta ''
tried ''
to TO
create ''
a (
commission ''
to TO
investigate ''
the DT
murder NN
. .

And DT
, ,
all ''
the DT
while ''
, ,
Panama ''

debt ''
problems ''
continued ''
to TO
grow NN
. .

Mr. DT
Noriega DT
was ''
growing ''
desperate NN
. .

In DT
late ''
1986 ''
, ,
he ''
made ''
an ''
offer ''
he ''
thought ''
the DT
U.S. DT
could ''
n't ''
refuse NN
. .

As DT
recounted ''
in IN
a (
stipulation ''
that ''
summarized ''
government ''
documents ''
released ''
for ''
the DT
North ''
trial ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
offered ''
to TO
assassinate ''
the DT
Sandinista ''
leadership ''
in IN
exchange ''
`` DT
for ''
a (
promise ''
to TO
help ''
clean ''
up ''

image ''
and CC
a (
commitment ''
to TO
lift ''
the DT
-LCB- ''
U.S. NN

-RCB- ''
ban ''
on ''

sales ''
to TO
the DT
Panamanian DT

'' .

`` DT
North ''

'' .
the DT
document ''
went ''
on ''

referring ''
to TO

, ,
`` DT
has ''
told ''
Noriega DT

representative ''
that ''

The DT
representative ''
responded ''
that ''
Noriega DT
had ''
numerous ''
assets ''
in IN
place ''
in IN
Nicaragua ''
and CC
could ''
accomplish ''
many ''

just ''

-RCB- ''
the DT
previous ''
year ''
in IN
blowing ''
up ''

Col. DT

conveyed ''
the DT

to TO
his ''

to TO
Assistant ''
Secretary ''
of IN
State ''
Elliot ''
Abrams ''

who ''
relayed ''
it ''
to TO

George DT
Shultz NN

Mr. DT
Noriega DT

proposal ''
was ''
turned ''
down NN

And DT
Mr. DT
Shultz ''
curtly ''
told ''
Mr. DT
Abrams ''
that ''

should ''
be ''
told ''
that ''
only ''
he ''
could ''
repair ''
his ''
tarnished ''

The DT
end ''

Within DT
weeks ''
the DT
unfolding ''

scandal ''
took ''
away ''
Mr. DT

insurance ''
policy NN

The DT
death ''
of IN
CIA ''
Director ''
William DT
Casey ''
and CC
resignation ''
of IN
Oliver ''
North ''
allowed ''
anti-Noriega ''
political ''
forces ''
to TO
gain ''
influence NN
. .

Public DT
protests ''
against ''
him ''
were ''
triggered ''
in IN
June DT
1987 ''
due ''
to TO
charges ''
by ''
Diaz ''
Herrera ''
, ,
his ''
former ''
chief ''
of IN

that ''
Mr. DT
Noriega DT
had ''
stolen ''
the DT
1984 ''
election ''
and CC
had ''
ordered ''
the DT
killing ''
of IN
Messrs. DT
Spadafora ''

Few DT
American ''

were ''
willing ''

to TO
defend ''
him NN

Lawyers DT
in IN
Miami ''
-- DT
this ''

without ''
impediment ''
-- DT
prepared ''
to TO
have ''
him ''
indicted ''

charges ''
in IN
February ''
1988 NN

During DT
negotiations ''
with ''

over ''
proposals ''
to TO
drop ''
the DT
U.S. DT
indictments ''
in IN

Mr. DT

often ''
asked ''
almost ''
plaintively ''
how ''
the DT
Americans ''

whom ''
he ''
had ''
helped ''
for ''
so ''

could ''

neither ''

out NN

Mr. DT

It DT

Old DT
Environmentalism ''
involved ''
microbe ''
hunters ''
and CC
sanitationists NN
. .

It DT
started ''
with ''
improvements ''
in IN
hygiene ''
made ''
possible ''
by ''
affordable ''
soap ''
and CC
washable ''
underwear ''
during ''
the DT
Industrial DT
Revolution NN

Then DT
cast-iron ''
sewer ''

and CC
the DT
flush ''
toilet ''
were ''
followed ''
by ''
sewage ''
- ''
and CC
water-treatment ''
plants ''
toward ''
the DT
end ''
of IN
the DT
19th ''
century NN
. .

Medicine DT
in IN
the DT
19th ''
century ''
was ''
dedicated ''
mostly ''
to TO
combating ''
sepsis ''
and CC
diagnostic ''
analysis NN
. .

Then DT
the DT
20th ''
century ''
saw ''
the DT
evolution ''
of IN
private-sector ''
wonder ''
drugs ''
, ,
which ''
promulgated ''
medical ''
therapy NN
. .

The DT
process ''
dramatically ''
increased ''
our ''
average ''
life ''
expectancy ''
, ,
eliminated ''
much ''
pain ''
and CC
constantly ''
improved ''
health ''
and CC
well-being NN
. .

Most DT
public-health ''
measures ''
were ''
handled ''
at ''
the DT
local ''
level NN
. .

New DT
Environmentalism ''
probably ''
started ''
in IN
1962 ''
with ''
the DT
publication ''
of IN
Rachel ''
Carson ''
's ''
book ''
`` DT
Silent ''
Spring NN
. .
'' .

Shortly DT
thereafter ''
, ,
hysterical ''
articles ''
began ''
to TO
appear ''
predicting ''
that ''
advanced ''
industrial ''
societies ''
would ''
produce ''
a (
blackened ''
, ,
uninhabitable ''
planet ''
possibly ''
by ''
the DT
turn ''
of IN
the DT
century NN
. .

These DT
apocalyptic ''
predictions ''
were ''
advanced ''
by ''
such ''
stalwarts ''
as ''
Paul DT
Ehrlich ''
, ,
Barry ''
Commoner ''
, ,
Rene ''
Dubois ''
and CC
George DT
Wald NN
. .

Writing DT
in IN
the DT
1960s ''
Ms. DT
Carson ''
suggested ''
that ''
the DT
human ''
race ''
could ''
be ''
eliminated ''
in IN
20 ''
years ''
, ,
and CC
Mr. DT
Wald ''
suggested ''
that ''
life ''
on ''
earth ''
might ''
end ''
by ''
1985 NN
. .

Mr. DT
Ehrlich ''
predicted ''
unprecedented ''
famine ''
by ''
1980 NN
. .

There DT
were ''
many ''
more NN
. .

Thousands DT
of IN
chemical ''
products ''
were ''
categorized ''
as ''
carcinogenic ''
, ,
with ''
recommendations ''
that ''
they ''
be ''
banned ''
from ''
industrial ''
use ''
because ''
they ''
produced ''
malignant ''
tumors ''
in IN
overdosed ''
rats NN
. .

Unknown DT
before ''
1960 ''
were ''
the DT
inconclusive ''
effects ''
of IN
acid ''
rain ''
, ,
greenhouse ''
warming ''
and CC
ozone ''
depletion ''
, ,
all ''
of IN
which ''
required ''
burgeoning ''
political ''
power ''
and CC
gargantuan ''
expense NN
. .

Meanwhile DT
, ,
the DT
New DT
Environmentalists DT
systematically ''
opposed ''
the DT
methods ''
of IN
the DT
Old DT
Environmentalists NN
. .

Local DT
pollution ''
problems ''
require ''
cheap ''
energy ''
and CC
capital ''
for ''
their ''
solution NN
. .

But DT
the DT
New DT
Environmentalists DT
oppose ''
private ''
wealth ''
creation ''
-LRB- DT
which ''
, ,
they ''
claim ''
, ,
depletes ''
natural ''
resources ''
-RRB- ''
and CC
nuclear ''
power ''
-LRB- DT
even ''
though ''
it ''
would ''
counteract ''
the DT
greenhouse ''
effect ''
-RRB- NN
. .

They DT
are ''
in IN
the DT
forefront ''
of IN
opposing ''
the DT
search ''
for ''
new ''
landfills ''
and CC
methods ''
of IN
incineration ''
and CC
even ''
oppose ''
new ''
methods ''
of IN
research ''
such ''
as ''
genetic ''
engineering NN

New DT
Environmentalism ''
is ''
an ''
emotional ''
attack ''
on ''
proven ''
methods ''
of IN
improving ''
our ''
quality ''
of IN
life ''
and CC
a (
bid ''
for ''

power NN

Let DT

Your DT
story ''

some ''

points ''
of IN
the DT
conference ''
on ''
`` DT
The DT
Global ''
Environment NN

Are ''
We DT
Overreacting ''
? NN
'' .

First DT
and CC
foremost ''
, ,
the DT
vignettes ''
presented ''
by ''
the DT
various ''
scientists ''
represent ''
a (
general ''
consensus ''
among ''
specialists ''
working ''
in IN
the DT
respective ''
aspects ''
of IN
the DT
global ''
environment NN
. .

Consider DT
, ,
for ''
example ''
, ,
the DT
greenhouse ''
effect ''
and CC
climate ''
change ''
; ''
numerous ''
blue-ribbon ''
scientific ''
committees ''
, ,
including ''
one ''
from ''
the DT
National DT
Academy ''
of IN
Science ''
, ,
judge ''
there ''
is ''
a (
greater ''
than ''
50 ''
% ''
probability ''
of IN
a (
grave ''
problem ''
in IN
the DT
offing NN
. .

The DT
point ''
was ''
to TO
answer ''
the DT
question ''
in IN
the DT
conference ''
title ''
, ,
not ''
to TO
try ''
to TO
create ''
news ''
stories ''
for ''
the DT
event ''
itself NN
. .

Nor DT
was ''
it ''
intended ''
to TO
dictate ''
a (
set ''
of IN
prescriptive ''
solutions ''
, ,
although ''
various ''
points ''
were ''
raised NN
. .

Each DT
speaker ''
was ''
asked ''
to TO
address ''
a (
specific ''
topic ''
, ,
not ''
deliver ''
a (
point ''
of IN
view NN
. .

Each DT
scientist ''
independently ''
concluded ''
society ''
and CC
government ''
are ''
underreacting ''
when ''
it ''
comes ''
to TO
substantive ''
policy ''
change NN
. .

This DT
leads ''
to TO
a (
very ''
special ''
sense ''
of IN
urgency NN
. .

If DT
the DT
media ''
decide ''
to TO
work ''
harder ''
at ''
educating ''
the DT
public ''
about ''
these ''
complex ''
and CC
technical ''
issues ''
, ,
that ''
hardly ''
can ''
be ''
termed ''
non-objective ''
journalism NN
. .

The DT
environment ''
can ''
no ''
longer ''
be ''
a (
normal ''
issue ''
, ,
to TO
be ''
dealt ''
with ''
on ''
a (
business-as-usual ''
basis ''
with ''
comfortable ''
increments ''
of IN
change NN
. .

We DT
have ''
literally ''
altered ''
the DT
chemistry ''
and CC
physics ''
of IN
our ''
planet ''
's ''
atmosphere NN
. .

This DT
portends ''
consequences ''
from ''
what ''
we ''
have ''
already ''
done ''
that ''
will ''
be ''
very ''
destabilizing ''
to TO
social ''
and CC
economic ''
systems NN
. .

The DT
problems ''
of IN
the DT
environment ''
are ''
so ''
interrelated ''
, ,
so ''
inextricably ''
entwined ''
with ''
our ''
current ''
way ''
of IN
life ''
and CC
so ''
large ''
that ''
it ''
is ''
unlikely ''
we ''
will ''
be ''
able ''
to TO
address ''
them ''
effectively ''
unless ''
major ''
changes ''
are ''
made ''
in IN
less ''
than ''
10 ''
years NN
. .

The DT
consensus ''
from ''
the DT
scientific ''
community ''
is ''
that ''
there ''
is ''
sufficient ''
evidence ''
to TO
advise ''
major ''
policy ''
changes NN

No DT

we ''
are ''
not ''
overreacting NN

`` DT
Any ''

With DT
this ''

this ''

the DT
two-thirds ''
who ''

This DT
is ''
not ''
nearly ''
good ''
enough NN

I DT
believe ''
any ''
physician ''
who ''
truly ''
cares ''
about ''
cancer ''
patients ''

both ''
today ''

tomorrow ''

should ''
offer ''

following NN

`` DT
New DT

These DT

to TO
the DT

the DT

established ''

the DT

The DT
inquiry ''

Charles DT
Keating ''

who ''

of IN
American ''

Corp. ''
, ,
Lincoln DT

parent ''

and CC
who ''
contributed ''
heavily ''
to TO
several ''
U.S. DT
senators NN

Mr. DT
Seidman ''
told ''
the DT
committee ''
that ''
the DT
Resolution ''
Trust DT
Corp. ''
, ,
the DT
agency ''
created ''
to TO
sell ''
sick ''
thrifts ''
, ,
has ''
studied ''
Lincoln DT
's POS
examination ''
reports ''
by ''
former ''
regulators ''
dating ''
back ''
to TO
1986 NN
. .

`` DT
My DT
staff ''
indicated ''
that ''
had ''
we ''
made ''
such ''
findings ''
in IN
one ''
of IN
our ''
own ''

we ''
would ''
have ''
sought ''
an ''
immediate ''
cease-and-desist ''
order ''
to TO
stop ''
the DT
hazardous ''
operations ''
, ,
'' .
Mr. DT
Seidman ''
said NN

When DT
Lincoln DT
was ''
seized ''
by ''
the DT
government ''
, ,
for ''
example ''
, ,
15 ''
% ''
of IN
its ''
loans ''
, ,
or ''
$ ''
250 ''
million ''
, ,
were ''
to TO
borrowers ''
who ''
were ''
buying ''
real ''

from ''
one ''
of IN
American ''
Continental ''
's ''
50 ''
other ''
subsidiaries ''
, ,
according ''
to TO
Mr. DT
Seidman NN
. .

But DT
the DT
government ''
did ''
n't ''
step ''
in IN
until ''
six ''
months ''
ago ''
, ,
when ''
thrift ''
officials ''
put ''
Lincoln DT
into ''
conservatorship ''
-- DT
the DT
day ''
after ''
American ''
Continental ''
filed ''
for ''
Chapter ''
11 ''
bankruptcy ''
protection ''
from ''
creditors NN

The DT
bankruptcy ''
filing ''
, ,
the DT
government ''
has ''
charged ''
in IN
a (
$ ''
1.1 ''
billion ''
civil ''
lawsuit ''
, ,
was ''
part ''
of IN
a (
pattern ''
to TO
shift ''
insured ''
deposits ''
to TO
the DT
parent ''
company ''
, ,
which ''
used ''
the DT
deposits ''
as ''
a (
cache ''
for ''
real-estate ''
deals NN

The DT
deposits ''
that ''
have ''
been ''
transferred ''
to TO

are ''
now ''
under ''

jurisdiction ''

`` DT
I DT
think ''

Mr. DT

`` DT

Mr. DT
Keating ''
, ,
for ''
his ''
part ''

has ''
filed ''

alleging ''
that ''

Leonard DT

Lincoln DT

treatment ''
by ''
former ''
thrift ''
regulators ''
, ,
in IN
an ''
agency ''
disbanded ''
by ''
the DT
new ''
law ''

has ''
proved ''
embarrassing ''
for ''
five ''
senators ''
who ''
received ''
thousands ''
of IN
dollars ''
in IN
campaign ''
contributions ''
from ''
Mr. DT
Keating NN

Mr. DT

The DT

yesterday ''
that ''

unhappy ''
with ''

asked ''

hired ''

financial ''
plans ''

told ''
the DT
committee ''
in IN
a (
private ''
meeting ''
yesterday ''
that ''
Eastern DT

latest ''
plan ''
to TO
emerge ''
from ''

protection ''
is ''
far ''
riskier ''
than ''
an ''
earlier ''
one ''
which ''
won ''
the DT

approval NN

According DT
to TO
one ''
person ''
present ''
at ''
the DT
meeting ''

Eastern DT

new ''
plan ''
is ''
financially ''
`` DT
overly ''
optimistic NN

Asked DT
about ''
the DT
consultants ''

reports ''

an ''
Eastern DT
spokeswoman ''

`` DT
we ''
totally ''
disagree NN

She DT
said NN
they ''
have ''
`` DT
oversimplified ''
and CC
made ''
some ''
erroneous ''
assumptions ''
that ''
make ''
their ''
analysis ''
completely ''
off-base NN

At DT
a (
later ''
news ''
conference ''
here ''
, ,
Frank DT
Lorenzo ''
, ,
chairman ''
of IN
Eastern DT
's POS
parent ''
Texas ''
Air ''
Corp. ''
, ,
said NN
Eastern DT
was ''
exceeding ''
its ''
goals ''
for ''
getting ''
back ''
into ''
operation ''
and CC
predicted ''
it ''
would ''
emerge ''
from ''
Chapter ''
11 ''
protection ''
from ''
creditors ''
early ''
next ''
year ''
, ,
operating ''
with ''
more ''
service ''
than ''
it ''
originally ''
had ''
scheduled NN
. .

He DT
insisted ''
, ,
as ''
he ''
has ''
before ''
, ,
that ''
creditors ''
would ''
be ''
paid ''
in IN
full ''
under ''
the DT
plan NN
. .

Mr. DT
Lorenzo ''
made ''
no ''
mention ''
of IN
creditors ''
' ''
negative ''
response ''
to TO
his ''
plan NN
. .

`` DT
We DT
're ''
in IN
the DT
process ''
of IN
discussing ''
an ''
amended ''
plan ''
with ''
the DT
creditors ''
and CC
anticipate ''
filing ''
that ''
amended ''
plan ''
shortly ''
, ,
'' .
Mr. DT
Lorenzo ''
told ''
reporters NN
. .

`` DT
We DT
're ''
meeting ''
and CC
surpassing ''
our ''
goals ''
, ,
'' .
he ''
added NN
. .

In DT
July DT
, ,
Eastern DT
and CC
its ''
creditors ''
agreed ''
on ''
a (
reorganization ''
plan ''
that ''
called ''
for ''
Eastern DT
to TO
sell ''
$ ''
1.8 ''
billion ''
in IN
assets ''
and CC
to TO
emerge ''
from ''
bankruptcy-law ''
protection ''
at ''
two-thirds ''
its ''
former ''
size NN
. .

But DT
after ''
selling ''
off ''
pieces ''
such ''
as ''
its ''
East ''
Coast ''
shuttle ''
, ,
its ''
Philadelphia ''
hub ''
and CC
various ''
planes ''
, ,
Eastern DT
hit ''
a (
stumbling ''
block NN
. .

It DT
could ''
n't ''
sell ''
its ''
South ''
American ''
routes ''
, ,
one ''
of IN
the DT
major ''
assets ''
marked ''
for ''
disposal NN
. .

Those DT
routes ''
, ,
valued ''
by ''
the DT
creditors ''
' ''
professionals ''
at ''
about ''
$ ''
400 ''
million ''
, ,
were ''
to TO
be ''
sold ''
to TO
AMR DT
Corp. ''
's ''
American ''
Airlines NN
. .

A DT
last-minute ''
snag ''
in IN
negotiations ''
with ''
AMR DT
, ,
over ''
an ''
unrelated ''
lawsuit ''
between ''
American ''
and CC
another ''
Texas ''
Air ''
unit ''
, ,
caused ''
the DT
deal ''
to TO
collapse NN
. .

Eastern DT
ultimately ''
decided ''
it ''
would ''
have ''
to TO
keep ''
and CC
operate ''
the DT
routes ''
itself ''
, ,
which ''
would ''
leave ''
it ''
with ''
less ''
cash ''
for ''
its ''
reorganization NN
. .

It DT
also ''
would ''
leave ''
Eastern DT
a (
bigger ''
carrier ''
than ''
the DT
scaled-down ''
one ''
proposed ''
under ''
the DT
initial ''
plan NN
. .

Those DT
changes ''
in IN
its ''
condition ''
meant ''
the DT
reorganization ''
plan ''
previously ''
presented ''
to TO
creditors ''
would ''
have ''
to TO
be ''
revamped NN
. .

Since DT
then ''
, ,
Eastern DT
has ''
been ''
negotiating ''
with ''
creditors ''
over ''
revisions ''
, ,
but ''
the DT
creditors ''
committee ''
has ''
been ''
having ''
problems ''
with ''
the DT
revisions NN
. .

The DT
committee ''
has ''
two ''
groups ''
of IN
experts ''
it ''
calls ''
on ''
to TO
analyze ''
Eastern DT
's POS
plans NN
. .

Both DT
said NN
the DT
new ''
plan ''
would ''
n't ''
work NN
. .

Ernst DT
& ''
Young ''
said NN
Eastern DT
's POS
plans ''
will ''
miss ''
its ''
projections ''
of IN
earnings ''
before ''
interest ''
, ,
tax ''
and CC
depreciation ''
by ''
$ ''
100 ''
million ''
, ,
and CC
that ''
Eastern DT
's POS
plan ''
presented ''
no ''
comfort ''
level ''
, ,
according ''
to TO
a (
source ''
present ''
at ''
yesterday ''
's ''
session NN
. .

Experts DT
from ''
Goldman ''
Sachs ''
estimated ''
Eastern DT
would ''
miss ''
the DT
same ''
mark ''
by ''
$ ''
120 ''
million ''
to TO
$ ''
135 ''
million ''
, ,
the DT
source ''
said NN
. .

The DT
experts ''
said NN
they ''
expected ''
Eastern DT
would ''
have ''
to TO
issue ''
new ''
debt ''
to TO
cover ''
its ''
costs ''
, ,
and CC
that ''
it ''
would ''
generate ''
far ''
less ''
cash ''
than ''
anticipated NN
. .

Other DT
costs ''
also ''
would ''
increase ''
, ,
including ''
maintenance ''
, ,
because ''
Eastern DT
has ''
an ''
older ''
fleet NN
. .

At DT
the DT
news ''
conference ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Lorenzo ''
and CC
Eastern DT
President DT
Phil ''
Bakes ''
presented ''
a (
far ''
rosier ''
assessment NN
. .

Flanked DT
by ''
flight ''
attendants ''
, ,
pilots ''
and CC
gate ''
agents ''
dressed ''
in IN
spiffy ''
new ''
blue ''
uniforms ''
, ,
they ''
said NN
Eastern DT
has ''
exceeded ''
its ''
operational ''
goals ''
and CC
is ''
filling ''
its ''
seats NN
. .

Starting DT
next ''
month ''
, ,
Eastern DT
will ''
begin ''
flying ''
775 ''
flights ''
daily ''
instead ''
of IN
the DT
previously ''
announced ''
700 ''
, ,
they ''
said NN
. .

Mr. DT
Bakes ''
declined ''
to TO
give ''
out ''
Eastern DT
's POS
daily ''
losses ''
, ,
but ''
said NN
he ''
did ''
n't ''
expect ''
Eastern DT
would ''
have ''
to TO
dip ''
into ''
the DT
cash ''
from ''
asset ''
sales ''
currently ''
held ''
in IN
escrow NN
. .

These DT
accounts ''
hold ''
several ''
hundred ''
million ''
dollars ''
, ,
primarily ''
from ''
asset ''
sales NN
. .

The DT
plan ''
Eastern DT
hopes ''
to TO
pursue ''
, ,
he ''
said NN
, ,
calls ''
for ''
Eastern DT
to TO
have ''
$ ''
390 ''
million ''
in IN
cash ''
by ''
year ''
's ''
end NN
. .

Both DT
he ''
and CC
Mr. DT
Lorenzo ''
predicted ''
that ''
plan ''
might ''
be ''
confirmed ''
in IN
January NN
. .

As DT
to TO
negotiations ''
with ''
creditors ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Lorenzo ''
said NN
in IN
remarks ''
after ''
the DT
conference ''
`` DT
we ''
'll ''
have ''
to TO
see ''
how ''
they ''
-LCB- ''
talks ''
-RCB- ''
come ''
along NN
. .
'' .

However DT
, ,
he ''
added ''
, ,
`` DT
it ''
's ''
not ''
a (
requirement ''
that ''
the DT
plan ''
be ''
accepted ''
by ''
creditors NN
. .

It DT
must ''
be ''
accepted ''
by ''
the DT
court NN
. .
'' .

Under DT
bankruptcy ''
law ''
, ,
Eastern DT
has ''
exclusive ''
rights ''
for ''
a (
certain ''
period ''
to TO
develop ''
its ''
own ''
reorganization ''
plan NN
. .

That DT
deadline ''
has ''
been ''
extended ''
once ''
and CC
could ''
be ''
extended ''
again NN
. .

If DT
Eastern DT
can ''
get ''
creditor ''
support ''
, ,
court ''
confirmation ''
of IN
its ''
plan ''
could ''
be ''
relatively ''
swift NN
. .

But DT
creditors ''
are ''
free ''
to TO
press ''
for ''
court ''
approval ''
of IN
their ''
own ''
plan ''
, ,
or ''
the DT
court ''
could ''
ignore ''
both ''
sides ''
and CC
draw ''
its ''
own NN
. .

In DT
any ''
event ''
, ,
some ''
people ''
familiar ''
with ''
the DT
case ''
question ''
whether ''
the DT
court ''
will ''
act ''
by ''
January ''
as ''
forecast ''
by ''
Mr. DT
Lorenzo ''
and CC
Mr. DT
Bakes NN
. .

Eastern DT
sought ''
bankruptcy-law ''
protection ''
a (
few ''
days ''
after ''
a (
crippling ''
strike ''
began ''
March DT
4 NN
. .

Mr. DT
Lorenzo ''
told ''
reporters ''
the DT
reorganization ''
Eastern DT
is ''
pursuing ''
would ''
create ''
a (
carrier ''
85 ''
% ''
to TO
90 ''
% ''
of IN
the DT
size ''
of IN
the DT
pre-bankruptcy ''
Eastern DT
. .

He DT
projected ''
it ''
would ''
be ''
operating ''
about ''
1,000 ''
flights ''
a (
day ''
by ''
late ''
spring ''
, ,
only ''
slightly ''
fewer ''
than ''
the DT
carrier ''
's ''
old ''
volume ''
of IN
1,050 ''
a (
day NN
. .

HOPES DT
OF ''
SIMPLIFYING ''
the DT
corporate ''
minimum ''
tax ''
before ''
1990 ''
are ''
weakening NN
. .

The DT
method ''
of IN
calculating ''
the DT
20 ''
% ''
tax ''
, ,
paid ''
if ''
it ''
exceeds ''
tax ''
figured ''
the DT
regular ''
way ''
, ,
is ''
due ''
for ''
a (
change ''
in IN
1990 ''
, ,
thanks ''
to TO
1986 ''
's ''
tax ''
act NN
. .

But DT
most ''
experts ''
agree ''
that ''
the DT
concept ''
that ''
is ''
to TO
be ''
introduced ''
drags ''
in IN
great ''
complexity ''
; ''
they ''
have ''
been ''
trying ''
to TO
head ''
it ''
off ''
this ''
year NN

Ways DT
and CC
Means ''
Chairman ''
Rostenkowski ''
backed ''
a (
simplification ''
plan ''
in IN
the DT
pending ''
House DT
tax ''
bill ''
, ,
but ''
the DT
plan ''
turns ''
out ''
to TO
be ''
a (
big ''
revenue ''
loser NN
. .

Now DT
the DT
Senate DT
's POS
stripped-down ''
bill ''
omits ''
any ''
proposal ''
to TO
deal ''
with ''
the DT
corporate ''
tax NN
. .

Proponents DT
of IN
simplification ''
fear ''
that ''
the DT
chances ''
of IN
getting ''
it ''
into ''
the DT
final ''
bill ''
are ''
waning NN

`` DT
We DT
hear ''
it ''

low ''
priority ''

the DT
House DT
side ''

'' .
says ''
Samuel ''
Starr ''
of IN
Coopers ''
& ''
Lybrand ''
, ,
CPAs NN

If DT
the DT
law ''
is ''

he ''
says ''
, ,
`` DT
we ''
are ''
left ''
staring ''
at ''
rules ''
that ''
are ''
almost ''
impossible ''
to TO
implement ''

because ''
there ''
are ''
so ''
many ''
complex ''

calculations ''

But DT
Congress ''
still ''
could ''
resolve ''
the DT
issue ''
with ''
other ''
legislation ''
this ''

Starr ''
adds NN

HUGO DT
'S ''
RAVAGES ''

areas ''

This DT

They DT
have ''
even ''
sent ''

We DT

'' .
says ''
Steve ''

coordinator ''
of IN
the DT
East ''
Bay DT
Regional ''

District NN

Two DT
years ''

decided ''
to TO
limit ''
the DT
bikes ''
to TO
fire ''
roads ''
in IN
its ''
65,000 ''

From DT
about ''
200,000 ''
six ''
years ''
ago ''

the DT
number ''
of IN
mountain ''
bikes ''
in IN
the DT
U.S. DT
is ''
expected ''
to TO
grow ''
to TO
10 ''
million ''
in IN
1990 NN
. .

At DT
least ''
half ''
that ''
growth ''
will ''
have ''
come ''
in IN
the DT
past ''
three ''
years ''
alone NN
. .

The DT
controversy ''
kicked ''
up ''
by ''
the DT
proliferation ''
of IN
these ''
all-terrain ''
bicycles ''
is ''
one ''
of IN
the DT
most ''
divisive ''
storms ''
to TO
blow ''
through ''
the DT
national ''
conservation ''
movement ''
in IN
recent ''
memory NN
. .

Bikers DT
-- DT
many ''
of IN
them ''
ardent ''
environmentalists ''
-- DT
proclaim ''
their ''
sport ''
an ''
efficient ''
, ,
safe ''
, ,
fitness-promoting ''
way ''
to TO
get ''
back ''
to TO
nature ''
, ,
while ''
asserting ''
a (
right ''
, ,
as ''
taxpayers ''
, ,
to TO
pedal ''
on ''
public ''
lands NN
. .

But DT
the DT
bikes ''
' ''
burgeoning ''
numbers ''
, ,
safety ''
concerns ''
and CC
fear ''
that ''
they ''
damage ''
fragile ''
landscapes ''
have ''
prompted ''
pleas ''
, ,
from ''
the DT
Sierras ''
to TO
the DT
Eastern DT
Seaboard ''
, ,
to TO
ban ''
them ''
from ''
the DT
back ''
country NN
. .

Key DT
to TO
the DT
issue ''
is ''
that ''
the DT
bikes ''
, ,
in IN
skillful ''
hands ''
, ,
can ''
go ''
virtually ''
anywhere ''
, ,
and CC
in IN
reckless ''
hands ''
can ''
become ''
vehicles ''
of IN
terror NN

An DT
adept ''
bicyclist ''
can ''
leap ''
from ''
a (
dead ''
stop ''
to TO
the DT
top ''
of IN
a (
picnic ''
table ''
without ''
losing ''
balance NN

Such DT
skills ''
allow ''
riders ''
to TO
fly ''
down ''
treacherous ''
mountain ''
grades ''
at ''
speeds ''
of IN
up ''
to TO
40 ''
miles ''
an ''
hour ''
-- DT
a (
thrill ''
for ''
the DT
cyclist ''
but ''
a (
nightmare ''
for ''
unsuspecting ''
hikers ''
or ''
equestrians NN
. .

For DT
harried ''
public-land ''
managers ''
across ''
the DT
nation ''
, ,
the DT
response ''
is ''
increasingly ''
to TO
shut ''
the DT
gates NN
. .

The DT
state ''
of IN
California ''
, ,
following ''
the DT
lead ''
of IN
some ''
regional ''
parks ''
, ,
recently ''
adopted ''
regulations ''
that ''
closed ''
nearly ''
all ''
hiking ''
paths ''
in IN
state ''
parks ''
to TO
mountain ''
bicycles NN
. .

The DT
move ''
largely ''
consigns ''
them ''
to TO
roads ''
used ''
by ''
motorized ''
vehicles NN
. .

Most DT
other ''
states ''
have ''
enacted ''
similar ''
bans NN
. .

The DT
bikes ''
are ''
unwelcome ''
on ''
trails ''
in IN
national ''
parks NN
. .

Even DT
the DT
U.S. DT
Forest ''
Service ''
, ,
whose ''
lenient ''
`` DT
multiple-use NN
'' .
philosophy ''
permits ''
motorized ''
vehicles ''
on ''
thousands ''
of IN
miles ''
of IN
its ''
trails ''
across ''
the DT
U.S. DT
, ,
has ''
begun ''
to TO
close ''
some ''
lands ''
to TO
the DT
bikes ''
, ,
including ''
major ''
portions ''
of IN
the DT
popular ''
Pacific ''
Crest ''
Trail ''
, ,
which ''
stretches ''
from ''
California ''
to TO
Canada NN
. .

Often DT
these ''
closings ''
come ''
after ''
vigorous ''
anti-bike ''
lobbying ''
by ''
conservation ''
organizations ''
, ,
the DT
politically ''
potent ''
Sierra DT
Club ''
among ''
them NN
. .

Sierra DT
has ''
been ''
instrumental ''
in IN
securing ''
a (
number ''
of IN
the DT
California ''
bans NN
. .

It DT
has ''
been ''
waging ''
an ''
all-out ''
campaign ''
to TO
beat ''
back ''
a (
proposal ''
, ,
pushed ''
by ''
Utah ''
bike ''
groups ''
, ,
to TO
allow ''
the DT
cycles ''
in IN
federally ''
designated ''
wilderness ''
areas ''
, ,
where ''
they ''
are ''
now ''
prohibited NN
. .

Yet DT
Sierra DT
's POS
hard-line ''
stance ''
has ''
created ''
something ''
of IN
a (
rift ''
in IN
the DT
organization ''
, ,
which ''
estimates ''
that ''
17 ''
% ''
of IN
its ''
500,000 ''
members ''
own ''
mountain ''
bikes NN
. .

Pressure DT
from ''
these ''
members ''
prompted ''
the DT
club ''
recently ''
to TO
soften ''
its ''
anti-bike ''
rhetoric ''
; ''
it ''
no ''
longer ''
, ,
for ''
example ''

lumps ''
the DT
bikes ''
into ''
the DT
same ''
category ''
as ''
motorcycles ''
and CC
other ''
terrain-marring ''
off-road ''
vehicles NN

But DT
the DT
club ''
still ''
insists ''
that ''

lands ''
ought ''
to TO
be ''
closed ''

unless ''

indicate ''

the DT

The DT

In DT

The DT

a (

came ''
to TO

strip ''

By DT

voted ''
to TO
preserve ''

despite ''

the DT
opposition ''
found ''
itself ''
undercut ''
by ''
an ''
unusual ''
alliance ''
of IN
liberals ''
and CC
conservatives NN

The DT
government ''
currently ''
is ''
subsidizing ''
an ''
estimated ''
23,000 ''
loans ''
above ''
11 ''
% ''
under ''
the DT

program ''

and CC
however ''
disruptive ''
to TO
private ''

expected ''
to TO
yield ''
at ''
least ''
$ ''
15 ''
million ''
in IN
savings ''
in IN
fiscal ''
1990 NN
. .

This DT
sum ''
has ''
been ''
guarded ''
jealously ''
by ''
appropriators ''
anxious ''
to TO
offset ''
spending ''
elsewhere ''
, ,
and CC
conservative ''
Sen. DT
Phil ''
Gramm ''
cast ''
the DT
fight ''
as ''
a (
populist ''
stand ''
against ''
monied ''
interests NN

`` DT
We DT
are ''
stewards ''
here ''
, ,
not ''
of IN
the DT
mortgage ''
companies ''
, ,
but ''
the DT
taxpayers ''

'' .
said NN
the DT
Texas ''
Republican NN

The DT
action ''
came ''
as ''
the DT
administration ''
won ''
final ''
congressional ''
approval ''
of IN
$ ''
9 ''
million ''
in IN
assistance ''
for ''
elections ''
scheduled ''
in IN
Nicaragua ''
in IN
February NN

The DT
bulk ''
of IN
the DT
money ''
would ''
be ''
funneled ''
through ''
the DT
National DT
Endowment ''
for ''
Democracy ''
, ,
but ''
the DT
legislation ''
is ''
so ''
vaguely ''
written ''
that ''
it ''
has ''
been ''
dogged ''
by ''
questions ''
regarding ''
the DT
money ''
's ''
true ''
purpose ''
and CC
its ''
ultimate ''
destination NN
. .

The DT
Senate DT
had ''
refused ''
late ''
Friday DT
to TO
invoke ''
cloture ''
and CC
limit ''
debate ''
, ,
but ''
behind ''
the DT
bipartisan ''
leadership ''
, ,
a (
solid ''
majority ''
took ''
shape ''
yesterday ''
and CC
brushed ''
aside ''
amendments ''
seeking ''
to TO
cut ''
the DT
total ''
package ''
or ''
steer ''
it ''
away ''
from ''
direct ''
aid ''
to TO
political ''
parties NN
. .

Final DT
approval ''
-- DT
on ''
a (
64-35 ''
roll ''
call ''
-- DT
was ''
never ''
in IN
doubt ''
, ,
but ''
the DT
opposition ''
drew ''
an ''
unusual ''
mix ''
of IN
senators ''
, ,
including ''
Republicans ''
Jesse ''
Helms ''
and CC
Warren ''
Rudman ''
and CC
Democrats ''
Bill ''
Bradley ''
and CC
John DT
Glenn NN
. .

The DT
money ''
will ''
be ''
applied ''
for ''
voter ''
registration ''
and CC
election ''
monitoring ''
, ,
but ''
more ''
than ''
half ''
is ''
likely ''
to TO
go ''
to TO
the DT
Union ''
Nacional ''
Opositora ''
party NN
. .

Critics DT
warned ''
such ''
cash ''
contributions ''
may ''
only ''
undercut ''
the DT
opposition ''
party ''
's ''
standing ''
, ,
and CC
one ''
irony ''
is ''
that ''
under ''
Nicaraguan ''
law ''
a (
major ''
portion ''
of IN
the DT
opposition ''
party ''
's ''
funds ''
must ''
be ''
shared ''
with ''
the DT
government ''
's ''
Supreme ''
Electoral ''
Council NN
. .

Within DT
the DT
appropriations ''
conference ''
yesterday ''
, ,
the DT
$ ''
67 ''
billion ''
measure ''
is ''
the DT
second ''
largest ''
of IN
the DT
annual ''
domestic ''
spending ''
bills ''
and CC
covers ''
a (
disparate ''
collection ''
of IN
accounts ''
for ''
science ''
, ,
housing ''
, ,
veterans ''
and CC
the DT
environment NN
. .

The DT
decision ''
to TO
raise ''
the DT
ceiling ''
on ''
FHA ''
home ''
loans ''
still ''
faces ''
strong ''
opposition ''
in IN
the DT
House NN
. .

But DT
it ''
is ''
driven ''
by ''
the DT
same ''
fiscal ''
pressures ''
that ''
have ''
forced ''
lawmakers ''
to TO
resort ''
to TO
various ''
bookkeeping ''
devices ''
to TO
juggle ''
as ''
much ''
as ''
$ ''
1 ''
billion ''
in IN
spending ''
that ''
would ''
otherwise ''
put ''
the DT
bill ''
over ''
budget NN
. .

These DT
costs ''
will ''
complicate ''
the DT
budget ''
picture ''
in IN
fiscal ''
1991 ''
, ,
and CC
the DT
measure ''
further ''
commits ''
Congress ''
to TO
a (
set ''
of IN
costly ''
projects ''
, ,
including ''
the DT
first ''
construction ''
funds ''
for ''
the DT
space ''
station NN

The DT
station ''
is ''
promised ''
$ ''
1.8 ''

within ''
the DT
$ ''
5.36 ''

provided ''
for ''
research ''

development ''
in IN
the DT
National DT
Aeronautics ''

Administration ''

and CC
the DT
nation ''

high-speed ''

plane ''
-- DT
cut ''
by ''
the DT
Senate DT
-- DT
could ''
receive ''
as ''
much ''
as ''
$ ''
60 ''
million ''
in IN
new ''
funds ''
or ''

. .

Similarly DT
, ,
the DT
House DT
agreed ''
to TO
add ''
back ''
$ ''
62 ''
million ''
to TO
continue ''
work ''
on ''
the DT
advanced ''
communications ''
technology ''
satellite ''
, ,
being ''
developed ''
by ''
General ''
Electric ''
Co NN

And DT
while ''
setting ''
a (
statutory ''
limit ''
of IN
$ ''
1.6 ''
billion ''
on ''
the DT
automated ''
space ''
probe ''
, ,
the DT
conference ''
appropriated ''
$ ''
30 ''
million ''
for ''
the DT
start-up ''
of IN
the DT
CRAF-Cassini ''
mission ''
, ,
a (
successor ''
to TO
the DT
Voyager ''
space ''
probe NN
. .

Among DT
major ''
domestic ''
agencies ''
, ,
the DT
Environmental ''
Protection ''
Agency ''
stands ''
to TO
receive ''
increases ''
significantly ''
beyond ''
those ''
sought ''
by ''
the DT
administration ''
, ,
with ''
pollution ''
abatement ''
and CC
control ''
accounts ''
growing ''
by ''
14 ''
% ''
to TO
about ''
$ ''
829.9 ''
million NN

An DT
estimated ''
$ ''
1.57 ''

is ''
separately ''
allocated ''
for ''
the DT
National DT
Science ''
Foundation ''

and CC
within ''
the DT

Urban ''
Development ''
Department ''
, ,
more ''
than ''

including ''
an ''
expanded ''
effort ''
to TO
modernize ''
public ''
housing ''
units ''
that ''
serve ''
the DT
poorest ''
families NN

To DT
an ''
unusual ''
degree ''
, ,
the DT
massive ''
bill ''
has ''
become ''
a (
vehicle ''
for ''
lawmakers ''
to TO
earmark ''
funds ''
for ''
projects ''
in IN
home ''
states NN

While DT
the DT
practice ''
was ''
discouraged ''
in IN
the DT
past ''

the DT
conference ''

is ''
laced ''
with ''
veterans ''

hospitals ''
, ,
environmental ''
projects ''
and CC
urban ''
grants ''
designated ''
for ''
specific ''
communities NN

The DT
most ''
striking ''
example ''
yesterday ''
may ''
have ''
been ''
in IN
community ''
development ''
funds ''
, ,
where ''
the DT
two ''
houses ''
had ''
separately ''
approved ''
a (
total ''
of IN
27 ''
projects ''
valued ''
at ''
$ ''
20 ''
million ''

and CC
the DT

added ''
15 ''
more ''
valued ''
at ''
$ ''
8 ''
million ''
to TO
ostensibly ''
preserve ''
`` DT
balance NN
'' .
between ''
the DT
House DT
and CC
Senate NN

Yesterday DT
's POS
conference ''
agreement ''
is ''
the DT
second ''
major ''
bill ''
to TO
emerge ''
from ''
negotiations ''
this ''
week ''
, ,
as ''
appropriators ''
approved ''
a (
fiscal ''
1990 ''
transportation ''
bill ''
late ''
Monday ''
that ''
includes ''
a (
sweeping ''
ban ''
on ''
smoking ''
on ''
most ''

airline ''
flights NN

An DT
exemption ''
will ''
remain ''
for ''

longer ''
than ''
six ''
hours ''
to TO
Hawaii ''
and CC
Alaska ''
, ,
but ''
estimates ''
by ''
the DT
tobacco ''
industry ''
yesterday ''
indicate ''
all ''
but ''
about ''

would ''
be ''
covered NN

Separately DT

a (

Senate DT
after ''

yesterday NN

And DT
after ''
weeks ''
of IN
delay ''

the DT
appropriations ''
process ''
is ''
beginning ''
to TO
take ''
some ''
final ''
shape NN

Defense DT

the DT
two ''
most ''
critical ''
areas ''

the DT
most ''

The DT
most ''
remarkable ''
feature ''
about ''

action ''
was ''
that ''
the DT
price ''
of IN
roughly ''

370 ''
an ''

enough ''
by ''

aggressively ''
sell ''

Mr. DT

said NN

`` DT
I DT
do ''

what ''
it ''
means ''
over ''

long ''
run ''

for ''

short ''

it ''
appears ''
that ''

$ ''
10 ''

so ''
that ''

has ''
risen ''
over ''

'' .
he ''
said NN

Previously DT
, ,
he ''
noted ''

tended ''
to TO
back ''
off ''
from ''
a (

letting ''

rise ''
as ''

as ''
possible ''
before ''

`` DT
The DT

When DT
the DT

announced ''
their ''

left ''

in IN
February ''

the DT
voices ''
of IN
skepticism ''
were ''
all ''

drowned ''
out ''
by ''
an ''
international ''
chorus ''
of IN
euphoria NN

It DT
was ''
`` DT
the DT
Soviets ''
' ''
Vietnam NN
. .
'' .

The DT
Kabul ''
regime ''
would ''
fall NN
. .

Millions DT
of IN
refugees ''
would ''
rush ''
home NN

A DT
resistance ''
government ''
would ''
walk ''
into ''
Kabul NN

Those DT
who ''
bought ''
that ''
illusion ''
are ''
now ''
bewildered NN

Eight DT
months ''
after ''
Gen. DT
Boris ''
Gromov ''
walked ''
across ''
the DT
bridge ''
into ''
the DT
U.S.S.R. ''
, ,
a (
Soviet-controlled ''
regime ''

Kabul ''
, ,
the DT
refugees ''
sit ''
in IN
their ''
camps ''
, ,
and CC
the DT
restoration ''
of IN
Afghan ''
freedom ''
seems ''
as ''
far ''
off ''
as ''
ever NN
. .

But DT
there ''
never ''
was ''
a (
chance ''
that ''
the DT
Afghan ''
resistance ''
would ''
overthrow ''
the DT
Kabul ''
regime ''
quickly ''
and CC
easily NN
. .

Soviet DT
leaders ''
said NN
they ''
would ''
support ''
their ''
Kabul ''
clients ''
by ''
all ''
means ''
necessary ''
-- DT
and CC
did NN
. .

The DT
U.S. DT
said NN
it ''
would ''
fully ''
support ''
the DT
resistance ''
-- DT
and CC
did ''
n't NN
. .

With DT
the DT
February ''
1987 ''
U.N. ''
accords ''
`` DT
relating ''
to TO
Afghanistan ''
, ,
'' .
the DT
Soviet DT
Union ''
got ''
everything ''
it ''
needed ''
to TO
consolidate ''
permanent ''
control NN
. .

The DT
terms ''
of IN
the DT
Geneva ''
accords ''
leave ''
Moscow DT
free ''
to TO
provide ''
its ''
clients ''
in IN
Kabul ''
with ''
assistance ''
of IN
any ''

-- DT
including ''
the DT
return ''
of IN
Soviet DT
ground ''
forces ''
-- DT
while ''
requiring ''
the DT
U.S. DT
and CC
Pakistan ''
to TO
cut ''
off ''
aid NN
. .

The DT
only ''
fly ''
in IN
the DT
Soviet DT
ointment ''
was ''
the DT
last-minute ''
addition ''
of IN
a (
unilateral ''
American ''
caveat ''
, ,
that ''
U.S. DT
aid ''
to TO
the DT
resistance ''
would ''
continue ''
as ''
long ''
as ''
Soviet DT
aid ''
to TO
Kabul ''
did NN
. .

But DT
as ''
soon ''
as ''
the DT
accords ''
were ''
signed ''
, ,
American ''
officials ''
sharply ''
reduced ''
aid NN
. .

In DT
February ''
1989 ''
, ,
when ''
the DT
Soviets ''
said NN
they ''
had ''
completed ''
their ''
pullout ''
, ,
the DT
U.S. DT
cut ''
it ''
further NN
. .

Not DT
so ''
the DT
Soviets NN
. .

Gen. DT
Gromov ''
himself ''
said NN
Soviet DT
troops ''
expected ''
to TO
leave ''
behind ''
more ''
than ''
$ ''
1 ''
billion ''
of IN
military ''
equipment ''
and CC
installations ''
for ''
the DT
Kabul ''
regime NN
. .

Since DT
the DT
troop ''
withdrawal ''
, ,
Moscow DT
has ''
poured ''
in IN
an ''
additional ''
$ ''
200 ''
to TO
$ ''
300 ''
million ''
worth ''
per ''
month ''
-- DT
nearly ''
$ ''
2 ''
billion ''
since ''
February ''
, ,
equivalent ''
to TO
the DT
total ''
U.S. DT
aid ''
to TO
the DT
resistance ''
in IN
nine ''
years NN
. .

This DT
includes ''
what ''
Deputy ''
Foreign DT
Minister ''
Yuli ''
Vorontsov ''
fetchingly ''
called ''
`` DT
new ''
peaceful ''
long-range ''
weapons ''
, ,
'' .
including ''
more ''
than ''
800 ''
SCUD ''
missiles NN
. .

By DT
early ''
May ''
, ,
Moscow DT
had ''
delivered ''
, ,
for ''
example ''
, ,
1,000 ''
trucks ''
, ,
about ''
100 ''
tanks ''
, ,
artillery ''
and CC
hundreds ''
of IN
other ''
combat ''
vehicles NN
. .

Later DT
that ''
month ''
, ,
it ''
added ''
an ''
entire ''
tank ''
brigade ''
, ,
including ''
120 ''
T-72 ''
tanks ''
and CC
more ''
than ''
40 ''
BMP ''
state-of-the-art ''
infantry ''
fighting ''
vehicles NN

By DT
September ''

a (
new ''
Reinforced ''

Rifle ''
Brigade ''
with ''
an ''
additional ''
300 ''
combat ''
vehicles ''

1,000 ''
more ''
trucks ''
and CC
10,000 ''
Soviet-trained ''
Afghan ''
troops ''
had ''
arrived ''
in IN
Kandahar NN
. .

In DT
the DT
last ''
few ''
weeks ''
, ,
Moscow DT
has ''
added ''
FROG-7B ''

the DT
bomber ''
version ''
of IN
the DT
An-12 ''
, ,
MiG-23BN ''
high-altitude ''
aircraft ''

and CC
Sukhoi ''
SU-27 ''
fighter-bombers ''
, ,
which ''
can ''
outfly ''
the DT
MiG-29s NN

Moscow DT
claims ''
this ''
is ''
all ''
needed ''
to TO
protect ''
the DT
Kabul ''
regime ''
against ''
the DT
guerrilla ''
resistance NN
. .

It DT
is ''
well-known ''
that ''
the DT
regular ''
Afghan ''
infantry ''
is ''
filled ''
with ''
reluctant ''
conscripts NN
. .

But DT
this ''
is ''
not ''
the DT
entire ''
Afghan ''
army ''
, ,
and CC
it ''
is ''
no ''
longer ''
Kabul ''
's ''
only ''
military ''
force NN
. .

Complete DT
units ''
have ''
been ''
trained ''
and CC
indoctrinated ''
in IN
the DT
U.S.S.R. ''
and CC
other ''
East ''
bloc ''
nations ''
; ''
30,000 ''
to TO
40,000 ''
of IN
these ''
troops ''
have ''
returned NN
. .

In DT
addition ''
, ,
the DT
regime ''
has ''
established ''
well-paid ''
paramilitary ''
forces ''
totaling ''
more ''
than ''
100,000 ''
, ,
including ''
35,000 ''
Soviet-trained ''
troops ''
of IN
the DT
Interior ''
Ministry ''
-LRB- DT
KHAD\/WAD ''
-RRB- ''
, ,
which ''
still ''
is ''
directed ''
by ''
1,500 ''
Soviet DT
KGB ''
officers NN
. .

Even DT
if ''
not ''
all ''
these ''
forces ''
are ''
committed ''
to TO
the DT
regime ''
, ,
they ''
are ''
now ''
dependent ''
on ''
it NN
. .

And DT
thousands ''
of IN
Afghan ''
children ''
have ''
been ''
taken ''
to TO
the DT
Soviet DT
Union ''
, ,
where ''
they ''
are ''
hostage ''
for ''
the DT
behavior ''
of IN
their ''
families NN
. .

Since DT
1981 ''
, ,
Indian ''
military ''
advisers ''
have ''
been ''
assisting ''
the DT
Kabul ''
regime NN
. .

In DT
preparation ''
for ''
the DT
withdrawal ''
, ,
Moscow DT
, ,
Kabul ''
and CC
New DT
Delhi ''
signed ''
two ''
agreements ''
for ''
several ''
hundred ''
newly ''
civilian ''
Indian ''
experts ''
to TO
replace ''
some ''
of IN
the DT
more ''
visible ''
Soviet DT
military ''
personnel NN

Cuban DT
military ''
personnel ''
also ''
have ''
been ''
active ''
in IN
Afghanistan ''
since ''
1979 NN
. .

The DT
Soviets ''
cut ''
a (
deal ''
with ''
Iran NN
: .
a (
future ''
Iranian ''
role ''
in IN
Afghanistan ''
in IN
exchange ''
for ''
Iranian ''
support ''
of IN
Soviet DT
policy NN
. .

The DT
deal ''
was ''
symbolized ''
by ''
the DT
restoration ''
of IN
the DT
Shi'ite ''
Sultan ''
Ali ''
Keshtmand ''
to TO
the DT
Afghan ''
prime ''
ministry NN
. .

Moreover DT
, ,
serious ''
questions ''
have ''
been ''
raised ''
about ''
the DT
claimed ''
withdrawal ''
of IN
Soviet DT
forces NN
. .

Before DT
his ''
assassination ''
in IN
1988 ''
, ,
President DT
Zia ''
of IN
Pakistan ''
repeatedly ''
stated ''
that ''
fresh ''
Soviet DT
troops ''
were ''
being ''
inserted ''
into ''
Afghanistan ''
even ''
as ''
others ''
were ''
ostentatiously ''
withdrawn NN
. .

Rep. DT
Bill ''
McCollum ''
-LRB- DT
R. ''
, ,
Fla. ''
-RRB- ''
reports ''
that ''
these ''
included ''
20,000 ''
to TO
30,000 ''
Soviet DT
Central ''
Asian ''
KGB ''
Border ''
Guards ''
, ,
ethnically ''
indistinguishable ''
from ''
Afghans ''
and CC
wearing ''
unmarked ''
uniforms NN
. .

Meanwhile DT
, ,
the DT
Kabul ''
regime ''
is ''
increasingly ''
successful ''
at ''
portraying ''
the DT
resistance ''
as ''
bloody-minded ''
fanatics NN
. .

In DT
this ''
they ''
are ''
aided ''
by ''
years ''
of IN
American ''
, ,
European ''
, ,
Pakistani ''
and CC
Saudi ''
support ''
for ''
the DT
most ''
extreme ''
factions ''
-- DT
radical ''
Islamic ''
fanatics ''
with ''
leaders ''
whose ''
policies ''
are ''
anathema ''
to TO
the DT
Afghan ''
public NN
. .

This DT
heavy ''
outside ''
support ''
for ''
the DT
worst ''
has ''
undermined ''
better ''
, ,
moderate ''
leaders NN
. .

In DT
autumn ''
last ''
year ''
, ,
for ''
example ''
, ,
the DT
regime ''
garrison ''
at ''
Kandahar ''
was ''
prepared ''
to TO
surrender ''
the DT
city ''
to TO
resistance ''
moderates NN
. .

At DT
the DT
last ''
minute ''
, ,
however ''
, ,
Pakistani ''
officials ''
sent ''
in IN
Gulbuddin ''
Hekhmatyar ''
, ,
perhaps ''
the DT
most ''
hated ''
and CC
feared ''
of IN
the DT
extremists ''
, ,
with ''
a (
demand ''
that ''
the DT
surrender ''
be ''
made ''
to TO
his ''
forces NN
. .

The DT
deal ''
fell ''
through ''
, ,
and CC
Kandahar ''
remains ''
a (
major ''
regime ''
base NN
. .

The DT
resistance ''
lacks ''
not ''
only ''
air ''
power ''
, ,
armor ''
and CC
expertise ''
but ''
often ''
such ''
essentials ''
as ''
maps ''
, ,
mine ''
detectors ''
, ,
or ''
even ''
winter ''
gloves NN
. .

Experienced DT
resistance ''
commanders ''
wanted ''
to TO
use ''
guerrilla ''
action ''
and CC
siege ''
tactics ''
to TO
wear ''
down ''
the DT
regime NN
. .

Instead DT
, ,
they ''
were ''
pressured ''
by ''
Pakistan ''
's ''
ISI ''
, ,
the DT
channel ''
for ''
their ''
support ''
, ,
into ''
attacking ''
Jalalabad NN
. .

They DT
took ''
more ''
than ''
25 ''
% ''
casualties ''
; ''
journalists ''
report ''
that ''
they ''
faced ''
minefields ''
without ''
mine ''
detectors NN
. .

The DT
wonder ''
is ''
not ''
that ''
the DT
resistance ''
has ''
failed ''
to TO
topple ''
the DT
Kabul ''
regime ''
, ,
but ''
that ''
it ''
continues ''
to TO
exist ''
and CC
fight ''
at ''
all NN
. .

Last DT
summer ''
, ,
in IN
response ''
to TO
congressional ''
criticism ''
, ,
the DT
State ''
Department ''
and CC
the DT
CIA ''
said NN
they ''
had ''
resumed ''
military ''
aid ''
to TO
the DT
resistance ''
months ''
after ''
it ''
was ''
cut ''
off ''
; ''
but ''
it ''
is ''
not ''
clear ''
how ''
much ''
is ''
being ''
sent ''
or ''
when ''
it ''
will ''
arrive NN
. .

For DT
months ''
the DT
resistance ''
has ''
been ''
defenseless ''
against ''
air ''
attack NN
. .

Thus DT
far ''
there ''
is ''
no ''
indication ''
that ''
they ''
have ''
been ''
re-supplied ''
with ''
Stingers ''
or ''
other ''
anti-aircraft ''
weapons NN
. .

Indeed DT
, ,
U.S. DT
officials ''
have ''
indicated ''
to TO
the DT
press ''
that ''
the DT
continuation ''
of IN
aid ''
depends ''
on ''
what ''
success ''
the DT
weakened ''
resistance ''
achieves ''
by ''
the DT
end ''
of IN
this ''
year NN
. .

Moscow DT
and CC
Kabul ''
must ''
have ''
found ''
that ''
information ''
useful NN
. .

For DT
a (
decade ''
U.S. DT
policy ''
has ''
been ''
incoherent ''
, ,
based ''
on ''
miscalculation ''
and CC
the DT
defense ''
of IN
bureaucratic ''
and CC
political ''
turf NN
. .

No DT
settlement ''
negotiated ''
by ''
others ''
can ''
force ''
the DT
Afghan ''
people ''
to TO
give ''
up ''
their ''
struggle NN
. .

A DT
cutoff ''
of IN
U.S. DT
military ''
aid ''
would ''
merely ''
abandon ''
them ''
to TO
die ''
in IN
vain NN
. .

Creation DT
of IN
a (
new ''

realistic ''
U.S. DT
policy ''
is ''

A DT

it ''

Mr. DT
Burton ''
says ''
conservatives ''
' ''
unhappiness ''
with ''
Mr. DT
Bush ''
's ''
cautious ''
handling ''
of IN
the DT
recent ''
unsuccessful ''
coup ''
in IN
Panama ''
will ''
make ''
them ''
more ''
willing ''
to TO
speak ''
out NN
. .

Of DT
course ''
, ,
neither ''
President DT
Bush ''
nor ''
the DT
Congress ''
has ''
actually ''
abandoned ''
the DT
Contras ''
or ''
SDI NN
. .

Mr. DT
Bush ''
has ''
struck ''
a (
deal ''
with ''
congressional ''
leaders ''
to TO
provide ''
nonlethal ''
aid ''
to TO
the DT
Contras ''
until ''
Nicaragua ''
holds ''
national ''
elections ''
next ''
February NN
. .

But DT
the DT
administration ''
has ''
dropped ''
any ''
effort ''
to TO
win ''
military ''
aid ''
for ''
the DT
rebels NN
. .

And DT
the DT
administration ''
's ''
deal ''
with ''
Congress ''
gives ''
several ''
congressional ''
committees ''
the DT
right ''
to TO
cut ''
off ''
even ''
humanitarian ''
aid ''
next ''
month ''
, ,
though ''
the DT
committees ''
are ''
likely ''
to TO
let ''
aid ''
continue ''
until ''
February NN
. .

Most DT
analysts ''
think ''
there ''
's ''
little ''
prospect ''
the DT
Contras ''
can ''
be ''
a (
significant ''
fighting ''
force ''
without ''
U.S. DT
arms ''
, ,
and CC
after ''
the DT
February ''
election ''
their ''
future ''
in IN
any ''
form ''
will ''
be ''
murky ''
at ''
best NN
. .

Instead DT
of IN
focusing ''
on ''
the DT
Contras ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Bush ''
has ''
switched ''
to TO
urging ''
members ''
of IN
Congress ''
-- DT
most ''
recently ''
in IN
a (
White DT
House DT
meeting ''
yesterday ''
-- DT
to TO
approve ''
financing ''
for ''
the DT
election ''
campaign ''
of IN
political ''
opponents ''
of IN
Nicaragua ''
's ''
Sandinista ''
government NN
. .

The DT
administration ''
continues ''
to TO
support ''
SDI ''
, ,
or ''
Star ''
Wars ''
, ,
and CC
it ''
recently ''
lobbied ''
to TO
persuade ''
the DT
Senate DT
to TO
restore ''
some ''
of IN
the DT
funds ''
it ''
planned ''
to TO
cut ''
from ''
the DT
program NN
. .

And DT
just ''
last ''
week ''
, ,
Defense DT
Secretary ''
Dick ''
Cheney ''
gave ''
a (
strong ''
speech ''
listing ''
`` DT
compelling ''
reasons NN
'' .
to TO
push ''
ahead ''
with ''
SDI ''
and CC
saying ''
he ''
'd ''
urge ''
President DT
Bush ''
to TO
veto ''
a (
defense ''
bill ''
with ''
`` DT
inadequate NN
'' .
funding ''
for ''
the DT
program NN
. .

But DT
the DT
strong ''
pitch ''
by ''
Mr. DT
Cheney ''
may ''
be ''
too ''
little ''
too ''
late ''
to TO
prevent ''
damage ''
to TO
SDI NN
. .

The DT
House DT
has ''
already ''
voted ''
for ''
a (
deep ''
cut ''
in IN
funding ''
, ,
and CC
in IN
the DT
end ''
the DT
program ''
's ''
backers ''
will ''
be ''
hard ''
pressed ''
to TO
head ''
off ''
some ''
reduction ''
in IN
spending ''
next ''
year NN
. .

And DT
while ''
the DT
defense ''
secretary ''
is ''
speaking ''
out ''
, ,
President DT
Bush ''
himself ''
has ''
n't ''
launched ''
any ''
high-visibility ''
campaign ''
to TO
drum ''
up ''
support ''
, ,
as ''
President DT
Reagan ''
did NN
. .

The DT
administration ''
also ''
acknowledges ''
that ''
it ''
is ''
n't ''
pursuing ''
Mr. DT
Reagan ''
's ''
original ''
vision ''
of IN
an ''
`` DT
impenetrable ''
shield NN
'' .
protecting ''
the DT
whole ''
U.S. DT
, ,
but ''
rather ''
a (
more ''
modest ''
version NN
. .

More DT
ominous ''
to TO
SDI ''
supporters ''
, ,
the DT
Bush ''
administration ''
appears ''
to TO
have ''
tacitly ''
accepted ''
a (
new ''
arms-control ''
proposal ''
from ''
the DT
Soviet DT
Union ''
that ''
spells ''
long-term ''
trouble ''
for ''
Star ''
Wars NN
. .

The DT
Soviets ''
have ''
agreed ''
to TO
complete ''
a (
treaty ''
cutting ''
strategic ''
weapons ''
without ''
including ''
restrictions ''
on ''
space-based ''
defenses NN
. .

But DT
the DT
Soviets ''
also ''
are ''
insisting ''
that ''
they ''
will ''
reserve ''
the DT
right ''
to TO
withdraw ''
from ''
the DT
completed ''
strategic-arms ''
treaty ''
later ''
on ''
if ''
the DT
U.S. DT
does ''
SDI ''
testing ''
or ''
deployment ''
that ''
the DT
Soviets ''
think ''
violates ''
the DT
existing ''
anti-ballistic-missile ''
treaty NN
. .

It DT
will ''
be ''
hard ''
down ''
the DT
road ''
to TO
persuade ''
Congress ''
to TO
approve ''
money ''
for ''
SDI ''
plans ''
if ''
lawmakers ''
fear ''
those ''
plans ''
could ''
scuttle ''
a (
completed ''
treaty NN
. .

As DT
a (
result ''
, ,
Frank DT
Gaffney ''
, ,
a (
former ''
Reagan ''
Pentagon ''
aide ''
who ''
now ''
heads ''
the DT
Center ''
for ''
Security ''
Policy ''
, ,
charges ''
that ''
the DT
administration ''

`` DT
professions ''
of IN
continued ''
commitment ''
to TO
development ''
and CC
deployment ''
of IN
the DT
SDI ''
program ''
strain ''
credulity NN
. .
'' .

Still DT
, ,
proponents ''
may ''
be ''
shying ''
away ''
from ''
more ''
drumbeating ''
because ''
they ''
sense ''
political ''
tides ''
have ''
turned ''
against ''
arming ''
the DT
Nicaraguan ''
rebels ''
or ''
boosting ''
spending ''
on ''
SDI ''
-- DT
particularly ''
when ''
the DT
public ''
perceives ''
the DT
Soviet DT
threat ''
is ''
declining ''
under ''
Mikhail ''
Gorbachev NN
. .

In DT
fact ''
, ,
because ''
communism ''
seems ''
to TO
be ''
beating ''
a (
global ''
retreat ''
, ,
some ''
conservatives ''
may ''
simply ''
be ''
so ''
pleased ''
that ''
their ''
anti-communist ''
philosophy ''
is ''
prevailing ''
that ''
they ''
do ''
n't ''
have ''
the DT
fire ''
at ''
the DT
moment ''
to TO
push ''
controversial ''
programs NN

`` DT
The DT

profile ''
of IN

But DT
they ''
say ''
they ''

n't ''
make ''

headway ''
because ''
of IN
a (
lack ''
of IN

these ''

that ''

Above DT

neither ''

Mr. DT

grew ''

tired ''

caused ''

called ''

prospect ''

`` DT
frankly ''
shocking NN

'' .

We DT
've ''
actually ''
read ''
the DT

Mr. DT
Allen ''
began ''
it ''
with ''
a (
warning ''
to TO
his ''
hosts ''
, ,
a (
California ''
church ''
group ''
that ''
opposes ''
rights ''
for ''

He DT
said NN
that ''
other ''

in IN

`` DT
do ''
not ''
believe ''
that ''

be ''
guaranteed ''

but ''
that ''
`` DT
I DT
mean ''
to TO
persuade ''

the DT
opposite ''

'' .

He DT
recalled ''
to TO
the DT
audience ''
a (
`` DT
strange ''

infelicitous NN
'' .
analogy ''
he ''
once ''
heard ''
arguing ''
`` DT
now ''
that ''
we ''
have ''

recognized ''
that ''
American ''
blacks ''
have ''
rights ''

we ''
need ''

do ''
the DT
same ''
for ''

'' DT
Mr. DT
Allen ''
objected ''
to TO
this ''
analogy ''
because ''
it ''
seems ''
to TO
`` DT
assimilate ''
the DT
status ''
of IN
blacks ''
to TO
that ''
of IN
animals ''
-- DT
as ''
a (
mere ''
project ''
of IN
charity ''
, ,
of IN
humaneness NN
. .
'' .

Rights DT
on ''
such ''
a (
basis ''
, ,
whether ''
for ''
blacks ''
or ''
homosexuals ''
, ,
are ''
`` DT
mere ''
indulgences ''
, ,
'' .
he ''
said NN
, ,
subject ''
to TO
being ''
taken ''
back NN
. .

He DT
says ''
the DT
title ''
of IN
his ''
speech ''
was ''
to TO
make ''
his ''
point ''
that ''
Americans ''
have ''
rights ''
as ''
individuals ''
, ,
not ''
as ''
members ''
of IN
certain ''
select ''
groups NN
. .

His DT
speech ''
criticized ''
the DT
`` DT
idiocy ''
of IN
notions ''
of IN
protected ''
groups ''
in IN
society NN
'' .
as ''
opposed ''
to TO
individual ''
equality ''
or ''
, ,
as ''
he ''
put ''
it ''
, ,
in IN
`` DT
a (
common ''
destiny ''
as ''
Americans NN
. .
'' .

Instead DT
of IN
lobbying ''
for ''
special ''
treatment ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Allen ''
said NN
that ''
homosexuals ''
and CC
others ''
should ''
try ''
to TO
ensure ''
equal ''
treatment ''
under ''
the DT
law ''
and CC
not ''
aim ''
for ''
special ''
privileges ''
that ''
would ''
risk ''
`` DT
invidious ''
retrenchment ''
with ''
government ''
complicity NN
. .
'' .

This DT
hardly ''
sounds ''
like ''
an ''
anti-homosexual ''
screed NN
. .

What DT
's POS
really ''
going ''
on ''
here NN
? .

The DT
three ''
most ''
important ''
things ''
to TO
understand ''
about ''
Mr. DT
Allen ''
is ''
that ''
he ''
is ''
a (
black ''
conservative ''
intellectual ''
-- DT
a (
triple ''
threat ''
to TO
the DT
liberal ''
establishment NN
. .

Mr. DT
Allen ''
, ,
who ''
teaches ''
government ''
at ''
prestigious ''
Harvey ''
Mudd ''
College ''
in IN
California ''
and CC
will ''
remain ''
a (
member ''
of IN
the DT
commission ''
, ,
has ''
spent ''
years ''
arguing ''
that ''
civil ''
rights ''
are ''
individuals ''
' ''
rights NN
. .

He DT
last ''
made ''
waves ''
when ''
he ''
dared ''
to TO
defend ''
an ''
Indian ''
girl ''
who ''
had ''
been ''
adopted ''
by ''
non-Indian ''
parents ''
off ''
her ''
reservation NN
. .

Mr. DT
Allen ''
quickly ''
ran ''
up ''
against ''
the DT
liberal ''
establishment ''
again ''
, ,
which ''
somehow ''
elevated ''
the DT
vague ''
concept ''
of IN
`` DT
Indian ''
rights NN
'' .
above ''
the DT
rights ''
of IN
individual ''
Indians NN
. .

There DT
is ''
a (
huge ''
divide ''
between ''
Mr. DT
Allen ''
's ''
we're-all-in-this-together ''
view ''
and CC
the DT
divisive ''
litigation ''
approach ''
of IN
the DT
civil ''
rights ''
groups NN
. .

Indeed DT
, ,
the DT
gap ''
is ''
so ''
large ''
that ''
Mr. DT
Allen ''
's ''
critics ''
refuse ''
to TO
engage ''
the DT
debate NN
. .

Their DT
ridicule ''
of IN
him ''
is ''
no ''
substitute ''
for ''
argument NN
. .

Their DT
effort ''
to TO
run ''
him ''
out ''

Washington ''
is ''
an ''
embarrassment ''
to TO
the DT
original ''
purpose ''
of IN
their ''

movement NN

We DT

liquidity ''

the DT
ability ''

and CC
out ''
of IN
the DT
market ''
quickly NN

Prices DT
are ''
moving ''
up ''

Trading DT
in IN

in IN
October ''

Yet DT

`` DT

The DT

adds ''
to TO
volatility NN

By DT

Some DT

Hans DT
Stoll ''

says ''
the DT
current ''
volatility ''
in IN
U.S. DT

the DT
1930s ''

decades ''
before ''

`` DT
I DT

`` DT
historically ''

'' .

Some DT

that ''

John DT

the DT

Some DT

In DT

The DT

Charles DT

a (

said NN
the DT

discovered ''

on ''
Monday ''
on ''
the DT
collection ''

networks ''
collectively ''
called ''
Internet ''
and CC
expected ''

Although DT

the DT

part ''

will ''
carry ''

once ''

Mr. DT
Redmond ''
said NN
the DT
intruder ''
had ''

yet ''
done ''
any ''
harm ''
but ''
the DT
agency ''
feared ''
`` DT
garbage ''
data ''
could ''
be ''
substituted ''
for ''

'' .

He DT
estimated ''
it ''
could ''
take ''
a (
day ''
for ''
a (
computer ''
security ''
manager ''
to TO
expunge ''
the DT
virus ''
from ''
a (
computer ''
system NN

The DT
intruder ''
, ,
among ''
the DT
broadest ''
yet ''
to TO
hit ''
a (
research ''
network ''

appeared ''
to TO
affect ''
only ''
Digital DT
Equipment ''
Corp. ''
hardware ''
that ''
uses ''
Digital DT
's POS
VAX\/VMS ''
operating ''
system NN
. .

It DT
is ''
unrelated ''
to TO
the DT
much-publicized ''
virus ''
that ''
last ''
year ''
infected ''
Arpanet ''
, ,
a (
much ''
larger ''
network ''
used ''
by ''
researchers ''
at ''
universities ''

laboratories ''
and CC
government ''
agencies ''
around ''
the DT
world NN

In DT
the DT
lingo ''
of IN
computer ''
security ''
, ,
the DT
NASA DT
intruder ''
is ''
technically ''
a (
computer ''
worm ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Redmond ''
said NN
. .

A DT
worm ''
resides ''
in IN
the DT
operating ''
system ''
of IN
a (
computer ''
and CC
spreads ''
by ''
boring ''
into ''
other ''
computers ''
contacted ''
through ''
networks NN
. .

The DT
Galileo ''
worm ''
apparently ''
was ''
hatched ''
on ''
a (
computer ''
in IN
France ''
hooked ''
up ''
to TO
NASA DT
's POS
Space ''
Physics ''
Analysis ''
Network ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Redmond ''
said NN

NASA DT
said NN
the DT
Galileo ''
worm ''
had ''
n't ''
affected ''
its ''
computers ''
or ''
the DT
computers ''
of IN
other ''
government ''
agencies ''
because ''
they ''
had ''
modified ''
their ''
systems ''
to TO
reject ''
worms NN
. .

But DT
Mr. DT
Redmond ''
said NN
the DT
worm ''
hit ''
universities ''
that ''
had ''
n't ''
elected ''
to TO
make ''
the DT
changes NN
. .

Michael DT
Alexander ''
, ,
a (
senior ''
editor ''
at ''
Computerworld ''
, ,
a (
trade ''
publication ''
, ,
said NN
he ''
was ''
told ''
that ''
the DT
worm ''
gets ''
into ''
a (
computer ''
center ''
by ''
looking ''
for ''
obvious ''
passwords ''
-- DT
such ''
as ''
ones ''
that ''
are ''
the DT
same ''
as ''
the DT
user ''
's ''
name NN
. .

If DT
it ''
finds ''
one ''
and CC
gets ''
into ''
the DT
system ''
, ,
it ''
will ''
display ''
a (
screen ''
when ''
a (
user ''
logs ''
on ''
that ''
says ''
, ,
`` DT
Worms ''
Against ''
Nuclear ''
Killers ''
... NN
. .

You DT
talk ''
of IN
times ''
of IN
peace ''
for ''
all ''
, ,
and CC
then ''
prepare ''
for ''
war NN
. .
'' .

In DT
addition ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Alexander ''
said NN
, ,
the DT
worm ''
sends ''
strange ''
messages ''
to TO
other ''
machines ''
at ''
the DT
center ''
-- DT
such ''
as ''
, ,
`` DT
George DT
Orwell ''
was ''
an ''
optimist ''
, ,
'' .
or ''
`` DT
Do ''
n't ''
feed ''
the DT
bats ''
tonight NN
. .
'' .

The DT
worm ''
also ''
looks ''
for ''
elementary ''
passwords ''
that ''
confer ''
more ''
privileges ''
on ''
the DT
user NN
. .

The DT
passwords ''
are ''
included ''
in IN
the DT
system ''
software ''
when ''
it ''
is ''
installed ''
but ''
are ''
supposed ''
to TO
be ''
replaced ''
as ''
soon ''
as ''
the DT
system ''
is ''
up ''
and CC
running NN
. .

If DT
it ''
finds ''
one ''
of IN
those ''
passwords ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Alexander ''
said NN
, ,
the DT
worm ''
will ''
do ''
such ''
things ''
as ''
change ''
users ''
' ''
passwords ''
to TO
a (
series ''
of IN
random ''
numbers ''
, ,
preventing ''
them ''
from ''
signing ''
on ''
to TO
the DT
network NN
. .

NASA DT
estimated ''
that ''
, ,
on ''
Monday ''
, ,
about ''
four ''
computer ''
centers ''
were ''
affected NN
. .

Yesterday DT
, ,
the DT
number ''
grew ''
to TO
40 ''
; ''
today ''
the DT
number ''
is ''
expected ''
to TO
grow ''
to TO
100 NN
. .

NASA DT
said NN
it ''
will ''
take ''
about ''
a (
week ''
before ''
it ''
knows ''
exactly ''
how ''
many ''
centers ''
of IN
the DT
6,000 ''
connected ''
to TO
Internet ''
were ''
affected ''
and CC
the DT
extent ''
of IN
the DT
damage ''
, ,
if ''
any NN
. .

Anti-nuclear DT
activists ''
have ''
protested ''
the DT
launch ''
of IN
the DT
Galileo ''
space ''
probe ''
to TO
Jupiter ''
because ''
it ''
uses ''
plutonium ''
to TO
generate ''
the DT
electricity ''
needed ''
to TO
run ''
the DT
craft NN
. .

Activists DT
fear ''
that ''
if ''
the DT
shuttle ''
carrying ''
Galileo ''
into ''
orbit ''
should ''
explode ''
, ,
or ''
if ''
Galileo ''
itself ''
crashes ''
into ''
the DT
Earth ''
during ''
the DT
two ''
times ''
it ''
flies ''
close ''
to TO
the DT
planet ''
, ,
fatal ''
levels ''
of IN
plutonium ''
would ''
be ''
released ''
into ''
the DT
atmosphere NN
. .

So DT
far ''
Galileo ''
has ''
been ''
delayed ''
twice ''
, ,
once ''
because ''
of IN
a (
computer ''
malfunction ''
connected ''
with ''
a (
space-shuttle ''
engine ''
, ,
and CC
yesterday ''
because ''
of IN
the DT
weather NN
. .

NASA DT
said NN
the DT
Galileo ''
worm ''
had ''
nothing ''
to TO
do ''
with ''
either ''
delay NN
. .

Mr. DT
Alexander ''
of IN
Computerworld ''
said NN
hackers ''
have ''
gone ''
after ''
SPAN ''
before NN
. .

He DT
said NN
the DT
Chaos ''
Computer ''
Club ''
, ,
of IN
West DT
Germany ''
, ,
once ''
managed ''
to TO
invade ''
SPAN ''
and CC
do ''
such ''
things ''
as ''
change ''
the DT
value ''
of IN
pi ''
, ,
messing ''
up ''
some ''
calculations NN
. .

It DT
is ''
now ''
a (
commonplace ''
that ''
prosecutors ''
are ''
bringing ''
criminal ''
indictments ''
in IN
cases ''
where ''
until ''
a (
few ''
years ''
ago ''
only ''
a (
civil ''
action ''
at ''
most ''
would ''
have ''
been ''
brought NN
. .

Yet DT
it ''
is ''
also ''
axiomatic ''
that ''
the DT
power ''
to TO
create ''
new ''
crimes ''
belongs ''
only ''
to TO
the DT
legislature ''
, ,
and CC
not ''
to TO
courts NN
. .

Beginning DT
in IN
the DT
early ''
19th ''
century ''
, ,
with ''
U.S. DT
v. ''
Hudson DT
and CC
Goodwin ''
, ,
the DT
Supreme ''
Court ''
has ''
repeatedly ''
held ''
that ''
a (
judicial ''
power ''
to TO
declare ''
conduct ''
to TO
be ''
against ''
the DT
public ''
interest ''
and CC
hence ''
criminal ''
, ,
while ''
well ''
established ''
in IN
British DT
law ''
, ,
would ''
usurp ''
legislative ''
authority ''
under ''
the DT
doctrine ''
of IN
separation ''
of IN
powers NN
. .

That DT
's POS
the DT
conventional ''
theory ''
anyway NN
. .

In DT
practice ''
, ,
however ''
, ,
the DT
line ''
between ''
interpretation ''
and CC
redefinition ''
of IN
the DT
criminal ''
law ''
long ''
ago ''
began ''
to TO
blur NN
. .

In DT
particular ''
, ,
a (
common ''
law ''
of IN
white-collar ''
crime ''
has ''
developed ''
with ''
surprising ''
rapidity ''
over ''
the DT
past ''
decade NN
. .

For DT
example ''
, ,
although ''
insider ''
trading ''
has ''
long ''
been ''
criminal ''
, ,
it ''
has ''
never ''
been ''
statutorily ''
defined NN
. .

In DT
1983 ''
, ,
the DT
Supreme ''
Court ''
tried ''
to TO
supply ''
a (
workable ''
definition ''
in IN
the DT
Dirks ''
v. ''
SEC ''
decision ''
, ,
which ''
found ''
that ''
liability ''
depended ''
on ''
whether ''
the DT
tipper ''
had ''
breached ''
his ''
fiduciary ''
duty ''
to TO
the DT
corporation ''
in IN
order ''
to TO
obtain ''
`` DT
some ''
personal ''
gain NN
'' .
and CC
whether ''
the DT
tippee ''
knew ''
or ''
recklessly ''
disregarded ''
this ''
fact NN
. .

Gradually DT
, ,
however ''
, ,
lower ''
courts ''
and CC
prosecutors ''
have ''
pushed ''
this ''
definition ''
to TO
its ''
breaking ''
point NN
. .

Consider DT
the DT
facts ''
underlying ''
the DT
1989 ''
conviction ''
of IN
Robert DT
Chestman NN
. .

Prior DT
to TO
a (
tender ''
offer ''
by ''
A&P ''
for ''
Waldbaum ''
Inc. ''
in IN
1986 ''
, ,
the DT
founder ''
of IN
the DT
Waldbaum ''
's ''
supermarket ''
chain ''
called ''
an ''
elderly ''
relative ''
to TO
tell ''
her ''
to TO
assemble ''
her ''
stock ''
certificates ''
for ''
delivery NN
. .

She DT
called ''
her ''
daughter ''
to TO
take ''
her ''
to TO
the DT
bank ''
, ,
who ''
, ,
in IN
turn ''
, ,
persuaded ''
her ''
husband ''
, ,
a (
Mr. DT
Loeb ''
, ,
to TO
run ''
this ''
errand NN
. .

Hearing DT
of IN
this ''
information ''
, ,
the DT
husband ''
discussed ''
it ''
with ''
his ''
broker ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Chestman ''
, ,
and CC
Mr. DT
Chestman ''
then ''
bought ''
for ''
his ''
own ''
account ''
and CC
other ''
clients NN
. .

Basically DT
, ,
Mr. DT
Chestman ''
was ''
a (
fourth-level ''
tippee NN
. .

Did DT
Mr. DT
Loeb ''
, ,
his ''
tipper ''
, ,
breach ''
a (
fiduciary ''
duty ''
-LRB- DT
and CC
, ,
if ''
so ''
, ,
to TO
whom ''
-RRB- NN
? .

Did DT
Mr. DT
Loeb ''
seek ''
personal ''
gain ''
-LRB- DT
and CC
if ''
so ''
, ,
how ''
-RRB- NN
? .

Or DT
did ''
Mr. DT
Chestman ''
only ''
hear ''
a (
market ''
rumor ''
-LRB- DT
which ''
one ''
may ''
lawfully ''
trade ''
upon ''
-RRB- NN
? .

The DT
line ''
seems ''
awfully ''
thin ''
for ''
criminal-law ''
purposes NN
. .

A DT
second ''
illustration ''
is ''
supplied ''
by ''
the DT
recent ''
guilty ''
plea ''
entered ''
by ''
Robert DT
Freeman ''
, ,
formerly ''
head ''
of IN
arbitrage ''
at ''
Goldman ''
, ,
Sachs ''
& ''
Co NN
. .

Essentially DT
, ,
Mr. DT
Freeman ''
had ''
invested ''
heavily ''
in IN
the DT
Beatrice DT
leveraged ''
buy-out ''
, ,
when ''
he ''
was ''
told ''
by ''
another ''
prominent ''
trader ''
, ,
Bernard ''
`` DT
Bunny NN
'' .
Lasker ''
, ,
that ''
the DT
deal ''
was ''
in IN
trouble NN
. .

After DT
placing ''
orders ''
to TO
sell ''
, ,
Mr. DT
Freeman ''
called ''
Martin ''
Siegel ''
, ,
an ''
investment ''
banker ''
at ''
Kidder ''
, ,
Peabody ''
& ''
Co. ''
, ,
who ''
was ''
advising ''
on ''
the DT
deal ''
, ,
to TO
confirm ''
these ''
rumors NN
. .

Mr. DT
Siegel ''
asked ''
Mr. DT
Freeman ''
who ''
his ''
source ''
was ''
and CC
, ,
on ''
hearing ''
that ''
it ''
was ''
Bunny ''
Lasker ''
, ,
responded NN
: .
`` DT
Well ''
, ,
your ''
bunny ''
has ''
a (
good ''
nose NN
. .
'' .

The DT
illegal ''
`` DT
tip NN
'' .
of IN
the DT
bunny ''
's ''
good ''
nose ''
was ''
then ''
largely ''
a (
confirmation ''
of IN
rumors ''
already ''
known ''
to TO
many ''
in IN
the DT
market NN
. .

Had DT
the DT
case ''
gone ''
to TO
trial ''
the DT
same ''
issues ''
would ''
have ''
surfaced NN
: .

Was DT
there ''
a (
fiduciary ''
breach ''
in IN
order ''
to TO
obtain ''
personal ''
gain NN
? .

Did DT
Mr. DT
Freeman ''
have ''
notice ''
of IN
this NN
? .

Finally DT
, ,
was ''
the DT
information ''
material NN
? .

Yet DT
, ,
all ''
these ''
issues ''
are ''
subsidiary ''
to TO
a (
more ''
central ''
issue NN
: .
Who DT
is ''
and CC
who ''
should ''
be ''
making ''
the DT
criminal ''
law ''
here NN
? .

It DT
is ''
not ''
my ''
contention ''
that ''
either ''
Mr. DT
Chestman ''
or ''
Mr. DT
Freeman ''
was ''
an ''
innocent ''
victim ''
of IN
prosecutorial ''
overzealousness NN
. .

Arguably DT
, ,
both ''
were ''
on ''
notice ''
that ''
their ''
behavior ''
was ''
at ''
least ''
risky NN
. .

But DT
even ''
if ''
they ''
behaved ''
recklessly ''
, ,
reasons ''
still ''
exist ''
to TO
fear ''
and CC
resist ''
this ''
steady ''
process ''
of IN
case-by-case ''
judicial ''
extension ''
of IN
the DT
law ''
of IN
insider ''
trading NN
. .

Courts DT
and CC
legislatures ''
make ''
decisions ''
in IN
very ''
different ''
ways ''
and CC
are ''
each ''
susceptible ''
to TO
very ''
different ''
kinds ''
of IN
errors NN
. .

After-the-fact DT
judicial ''
examination ''
of IN
an ''
actor ''
's ''
conduct ''
has ''
always ''
been ''
the DT
common ''
law ''
's ''
method NN
. .

When DT
only ''
civil ''
liability ''
is ''
involved ''
, ,
this ''
method ''
has ''
the DT
undeniable ''
strengths ''
of IN
factual ''
specificity ''
and CC
avoidance ''
of IN
overgeneralization NN
. .

Still DT
, ,
case-by-case ''
retrospective ''
decision ''
making ''
of IN
this ''
sort ''
is ''
vulnerable ''
to TO
the DT
tunnel ''
vision ''
caused ''
by ''
a (
fixation ''
on ''
ad ''
hoc ''
-LRB- DT
and CC
usually ''
sleazy ''
-RRB- ''
examples NN
. .

When DT
a (
court ''
decides ''
that ''
a (
particular ''
actor ''
's ''
conduct ''
was ''
culpable ''
and CC
so ''
extends ''
the DT
definition ''
of IN
insider ''
trading ''
to TO
reach ''
this ''
conduct ''
, ,
it ''
does ''
not ''
see ''
the DT
potentially ''
enormous ''
number ''
of IN
other ''
cases ''
that ''
will ''
be ''
covered ''
by ''
the DT
expanded ''
rule NN
. .

Thus DT
, ,
a (
court ''
is ''
poorly ''
positioned ''
to TO
make ''
judgments ''
about ''
the DT
social ''
utility ''
of IN
the DT
expanded ''
rule NN
. .

For DT
example ''
, ,
in IN
focusing ''
on ''
Mr. DT
Freeman ''
's ''
attempt ''
to TO
gain ''
nonpublic ''
information ''
about ''
a (
deal ''
's ''
collapse ''
, ,
one ''
does ''
not ''
naturally ''
think ''
about ''
the DT
reverse ''
side ''
of IN
the DT
coin NN
: .
What DT
if ''
the DT
rumor ''
had ''
been ''
false NN
? .

Can DT
a (
security ''
analyst ''
call ''
an ''
investment ''
banker ''
to TO
make ''
certain ''
that ''
a (
seemingly ''
improbable ''
rumor ''
is ''
in IN
fact ''
false NN
? .

In DT
the DT
past ''
, ,
not ''
only ''
would ''
reputable ''
professionals ''
have ''
rushed ''
to TO
check ''
out ''
such ''
rumors ''
with ''
the DT
company ''
, ,
but ''
companies ''
listed ''
on ''
the DT
major ''
stock ''
exchanges ''
were ''
encouraged ''
by ''
the DT
exchanges ''
to TO
respond ''
openly ''
to TO
such ''
inquiries ''
from ''
securities ''
analysts NN
. .

Today DT
, ,
after ''
Mr. DT
Freeman ''
's ''
plea ''
, ,
there ''
is ''
an ''
uncertainty ''
that ''
is ''
both ''
unfair ''
and CC
inefficient NN
. .

In DT
this ''
light ''
, ,
the DT
comparative ''
advantages ''
of IN
legislative ''
law-making ''
become ''
clear NN
: .
-LRB- DT
1 ''
-RRB- ''
Before DT
it ''
acts ''
, ,
the DT
legislature ''
typically ''
will ''
hear ''
the DT
views ''
of IN
representatives ''
of IN
all ''
those ''
affected ''
by ''
its ''
decision ''
, ,
not ''
just ''
the DT
immediate ''
parties ''
before ''
the DT
court ''
; ''
and CC
-LRB- DT
2 ''
-RRB- ''
the DT
legislature ''
can ''
frame ''
`` DT
bright ''
line NN
'' .
standards ''
that ''
create ''
less ''
uncertainty ''
than ''
the DT
fact-bound ''
decisions ''
of IN
courts NN
. .

Although DT
legislative ''
lines ''
can ''
result ''
in IN
under-inclusion ''
-LRB- DT
which ''
explains ''
why ''
the DT
SEC ''
has ''
long ''
resisted ''
a (
legislative ''
definition ''
of IN
insider ''
trading ''
-RRB- ''
, ,
judicial ''
lawmaking ''
inevitably ''
creates ''
uncertainty ''
because ''
of IN
the DT
shadowy ''
outer ''
edges ''
and CC
implications ''
of IN
most ''
judicial ''
decisions NN
. .

At DT
least ''
when ''
the DT
stakes ''
are ''
high ''
, ,
uncertainty ''
in IN
turn ''
results ''
in IN
overinclusion ''
, ,
as ''
individuals ''
do ''
not ''
dare ''
to TO
approach ''
an ''
uncertain ''
line ''
closely NN
. .

The DT
federal ''
mail ''
and CC
wire ''
fraud ''
statutes ''
provide ''
even ''
better ''
illustrations ''
of IN
the DT
rapid ''
evolution ''
of IN
a (
federal ''
common ''
law ''
of IN
white-collar ''
crime NN
. .

In DT
1987 ''
, ,
the DT
Supreme ''
Court ''
attempted ''
in IN
McNally ''
v. ''
U.S. DT
to TO
halt ''
the DT
inexorable ''
expansion ''
of IN
these ''
statutes ''
by ''
adopting ''
a (
rule ''
of IN
strict ''
construction ''
for ''
ambiguous ''
criminal ''
statues NN
. .

Yet DT
, ,
late ''
last ''
year ''
, ,
Congress ''
effectively ''
reversed ''
this ''
decision ''
by ''
enacting ''
a (
one-sentence ''
statute ''
that ''
defined ''
fraud ''
to TO
include ''
any ''
scheme ''
to TO
deprive ''
another ''
of IN
`` DT
the DT
intangible ''
right ''
of IN
honest ''
services NN
. .
'' .

At DT
a (
stroke ''
, ,
this ''
may ''
criminalize ''
all ''
fiduciary ''
breaches ''
-LRB- DT
and CC
possibly ''
all ''
misrepresentations ''
by ''
an ''
agent ''
or ''
employee ''
-RRB- NN
. .

Such DT
a (
statute ''
illustrates ''
the DT
fundamental ''
problem NN
: .
Congress ''
finds ''
it ''
is ''
easier ''
to TO
pass ''
sweepingly ''
moralistic ''
prohibitions ''
, ,
which ''
the DT
courts ''
must ''
thereafter ''
interpret ''
, ,
than ''
to TO
engage ''
in IN
the DT
difficult ''
line-drawing ''
distinctions ''
that ''
are ''
inherently ''
its ''
responsibility NN
. .

We DT
are ''
confronted ''
less ''
with ''
a (
judicial ''
power ''
grab ''
than ''
with ''
a (
legislative ''
giveaway NN
. .

Predictably DT
, ,
when ''
confronted ''
with ''
morally ''
dubious ''
behavior ''
, ,
prosecutors ''
will ''
exploit ''
the DT
latitude ''
such ''
openended ''
statutes ''
give ''
them NN
. .

Over DT
the DT
long ''
run ''
, ,
however ''
, ,
sleazy ''
cases ''
will ''
make ''
bad ''
law NN

At DT
the DT
recent ''
meetings ''
of IN
the DT
World ''
Bank DT
and CC
International DT
Monetary ''
Fund ''
, ,
the DT
Bush ''
administration ''
announced ''
its ''
intention ''
to TO
decide ''
by ''
yearend ''
the DT
size ''
of IN
the DT
next ''
increase ''
in IN
the DT
IMF ''
's ''
capital ''
base NN

While DT
the DT
U.S. DT
share ''
of IN
the DT
increase ''
probably ''
will ''
not ''
reach ''
the DT
$ ''
12 ''
billion ''
or ''
more ''
implicit ''
in IN
the DT
IMF ''
's ''
request ''
for ''
a (
doubling ''
of IN
its ''
$ ''
90 ''
billion ''
capital ''
, ,
the DT
administration ''
probably ''
will ''
agree ''
to TO
a (
multibillion-dollar ''
increase NN

This DT
would ''
be ''
consistent ''
with ''
its ''
unwavering ''
support ''
for ''
the DT
Brady ''
Plan ''
and CC
G-7 ''
exchange-rate ''
intervention ''
, ,
and CC
with ''
its ''
financial ''
commitment ''
to TO
Mexico ''
, ,
Poland ''
and CC
others NN
. .

The DT
IMF ''
has ''
several ''
reasons ''
for ''
requesting ''
the DT
increase NN
. .

Its DT
role ''
in IN
the DT
economies ''
of IN
developing ''
countries ''
has ''
grown ''
steadily ''
since ''
the DT
1970s NN
. .

The DT
size ''

pace ''

accelerate ''
further ''
under ''
the DT
Brady ''
Plan ''
, ,
which ''
promises ''
larger ''
and CC
earlier ''
disbursements ''
to TO
approved ''
countries NN
. .

At DT
least ''
three ''
other ''
factors ''
have ''
encouraged ''
the DT
IMF ''
to TO
insist ''
on ''
increased ''
capital NN
. .

First DT
, ,
it ''
argues ''
that ''
its ''
capital ''
base ''
must ''
be ''
increased ''
in IN
order ''
to TO
maintain ''
its ''
size ''
relative ''
to TO
world ''
financial ''
markets ''
, ,
for ''
which ''
it ''
feels ''
some ''
responsibility NN

Second DT
, ,
the DT
World ''
Bank DT
's POS
recent ''
$ ''
75 ''
billion ''
capital ''
increase ''
-- DT
$ ''
14 ''
billion ''
from ''
the DT
U.S. DT
-- DT
has ''
left ''
the DT
IMF ''
feeling ''
less ''
than ''
first ''
fiddle ''
among ''
international ''
financial ''
institutions NN
. .

Third DT
, ,
the DT
IMF ''
would ''
like ''
to TO
meet ''
Japan DT
's POS
request ''
for ''
increased ''
ownership ''
-LRB- DT
currently ''
4.5 ''
% ''
-RRB- NN
. .

Japan DT
has ''
supported ''
a (
larger ''
role ''
for ''
the DT
IMF ''
in IN
developing-country ''
debt ''
issues ''
, ,
and CC
is ''
an ''
important ''
financial ''
resource ''
for ''
IMF-guided ''
programs ''
in IN
developing ''
countries NN
. .

While DT
international ''
politics ''
may ''
argue ''
for ''
the DT
capital ''
increase ''
, ,
there ''
is ''
a (
clear ''
economic ''
case ''
against ''
it NN
. .

Opponents DT
of IN
the DT
increase ''
argue ''
that ''
the DT
IMF ''
practices ''
central ''
planning ''
while ''
supporting ''
ineffective ''
governments NN
. .

They DT
question ''
whether ''
the DT
IMF ''
has ''
any ''
role ''
in IN
developing ''
countries ''
, ,
given ''
its ''
original ''
mandate ''
to TO
assist ''
industrial ''
countries ''
in IN
balance-of-payments ''
emergencies NN
. .

Opponents DT
show ''
that ''
there ''
are ''
already ''
more ''
funds ''
available ''
than ''
commendable ''
reform ''
efforts NN
. .

They DT
worry ''
that ''
new ''
IMF ''
funding ''
of IN
developing ''
countries ''
will ''
simply ''
end ''
up ''
substituting ''
IMF ''
debt ''
for ''
reschedulable ''
commercial ''
bank ''
debt ''
, ,
a (
bad ''
trade ''
all ''
around NN
. .

They DT
believe ''
microeconomics ''
, ,
which ''
addresses ''
the DT
problems ''
of IN
markets ''
, ,
investment ''
climate ''
and CC
management ''
practices ''
, ,
is ''
the DT
key ''
to TO
developing-country ''
growth ''
, ,
not ''
the DT
IMF ''
's ''
Keynesian ''
focus ''
on ''
trade ''
deficits ''
, ,
quarterly ''
targets ''
and CC
government ''
debt NN
. .

They DT
point ''
at ''
the DT
numerous ''
developing-country ''
governments ''
that ''
have ''
inflated ''
, ,
taxed ''
and CC
regulated ''
themselves ''
into ''
despair ''
under ''
successive ''
IMF ''
programs NN
. .

Decisions DT
on ''
increases ''
in IN
the DT
IMF ''
's ''
capital ''
base ''
traditionally ''
are ''
made ''
by ''
the DT
administration ''
, ,
with ''
subsequent ''
authorization ''
by ''
Congress NN
. .

The DT
last ''
U.S. DT
congressional ''
authorization ''
, ,
in IN
1983 ''
, ,
was ''
a (
political ''
donnybrook ''
and CC
carried ''
a (
$ ''
6 ''
billion ''
housing ''
program ''
along ''
with ''
it ''
to TO
secure ''
adequate ''
votes NN
. .

The DT
politics ''
of IN
the DT
1990 ''
congressional ''
authorization ''
are ''
likely ''
to TO
be ''
similar ''
to TO
those ''
of IN
previous ''
authorizations NN
. .

Liberals DT
may ''
support ''
the DT
stabilizing ''
, ,
quasi-governmental ''
role ''
of IN
the DT
IMF ''
on ''
two ''
conditions NN
: .
that ''
the DT
administration ''
give ''
assurances ''
that ''
liberal ''
Democrats ''
' ''
support ''
will ''
not ''
be ''
used ''
against ''
them ''
in IN
congressional ''
re-election ''
campaigns ''
; ''
and CC
that ''
the DT
legislation ''
address ''
-- DT
with ''
dollars ''
-- DT
social ''
and CC
environmental ''
concerns NN

Conservative DT
Republicans ''
will ''
be ''
given ''
the DT

On DT
the DT

a (

With DT

Upping DT

that ''

The DT
move ''

which ''

U.S. DT
central ''

ready ''

that ''
while ''
the DT
Fed DT

move ''
to TO
loosen ''
credit ''
has ''
n't ''
been ''
aggressive ''

it ''
nevertheless ''

the DT
Fed DT

relaxed ''

That DT

the DT
view ''

some ''

Both DT

Ford DT

latest ''
move ''
increases ''
the DT
pressure ''
on ''

to TO
complete ''

current ''
talks ''

quickly NN

GM DT
is ''
likely ''
to TO
reach ''

pact ''

two ''

a (

their ''

doubling ''
Jaguar DT

yearly ''

50,000 ''

Jaguar DT
shareholders ''
would ''
have ''

Ford DT

the DT
U.K. ''

the DT

Hachette DT

the DT

the DT

the DT
