Mr. NNP

Mr. NNP

Mr. NNP

Yet ``
it PRP

also RB
axiomatic VBN
that IN

Beginning ``

with IN
U.S. NNP

Goodwin MD

the DT

repeatedly RB

hence MD
criminal ``

That ``

In ``

the DT

In ``

developed VBN

For ``

although CC

long RB

criminal NN

it PRP

never RB

statutorily TO

In ``
1983 PRP

the DT

tried CC

a DT

in IN
the DT

which WDT

Gradually ``

Consider ``

facts NN

Robert ``

Prior CC

Basically ``

Mr. VBD

The ``

Essentially ``

Mr. VBD

After ``

The ``

largely RB
a DT

Did ``

Finally ``

all ``

It ``

Arguably ``

When ``

Still ``
